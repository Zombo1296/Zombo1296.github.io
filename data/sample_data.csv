2008-07-03,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its market share compared to its rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), according to a July 1st report from iSuppli. AMD’s market share has increased 2.2% over the last year compared to a decline in Intel’s share of .7%. iSuppli estimates that about half of AMD’s growth came at a cost to Intel’s market share, the rest of the growth came from smaller competitors.
The two companies dominate the market for processors with a combined 92.7% of the market. Although Intel’s portion of the market is still far larger than AMD’s, AMD is making a push and represents a better value to investors. While Intel chips were used in about 7 times more devices in the first quarter, Intel is also a far larger company with a market capitalization of nearly 3700% bigger than AMD’s. AMD is already a decent and improving competitor to Intel and the stock is selling at 16 year lows.
While many industries have been hampered by strained consumer spending, up to this point, the PC industry has been buoyed by the consumer. The first quarter was better than expected—in spite of a nationwide business spending slowdown on IT—the consumer has picked up the slack and thus are driving the market now more than ever before. AMD seems to be attracting the consumer and small business users with its relatively cheap new product lines for desktops; its quad-core Phenom chips and its tri-core processors.
AMD’s stock suffered in 2007 (down nearly 70%) from disappointing product launches of the Phenom and Opteron chips, but sales are rebounding as the kinks have been worked out. Furthermore, the price wars that had hampered gross margins on processors seem to have subsided as prices have not lowered from the fourth quarter to the first.
We think it is reasonable to expect AMD to continue to eat into Intel’s domination of the processor market. AMD’s products are coming into their own and the “Puma” platform made for laptops is set to be released soon. From a value prospective, we find AMD to be enticing at this price level. The stock is trading below their historical range of price-to-cash range of 6.4 to 17.1; the current level is 6.1 times. AMD is even more attractive on a price-to-sales basis—the historically normal range for AMD is to trade at .92 to 2.62 times revenue—but right now the stock is trading at only .54 times revenue per share.
If AMD can continue to increase sales, even in a difficult spending environment, we see no reason why the stock should not sell at $7 per share. Then when the macro-factors improve, just for AMD to be selling at their historical averages of price-to-sales and price-to-cash, we would expect to see a price of $12."
2008-07-10,"If you've taken a peek at Nvidia's stock recently (NASDAQ:NVDA) you may have noticed that it is trading at $11.82, down some 33% from a week ago, and down 66% from its 52 week high. What gives?
Last week Nvidia had a pre-earnings announcement warning that revenues and margins wouldn't meet analysts expectations. Its reason?
""The estimated decrease in revenue and gross margin is due to several reasons: end-market weakness around the world, the delayed ramp of a next generation MCP, and price adjustments of our GPU products to respond to competitive products,"" the company said in a statement.
MCP stands for Media and Communications Processor. For those that are unfamiliar with the industry, Nvidia is simply referring to a new ""platform"" for its processors. The big thing here is the ""price adjustments of our GPU products."" This is because Nvidia has but one competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
Late last year, when AMD was announcing constant delays to its products, many if not most people counted AMD out of the race for the next generation of chips. But despite all of the drama over people calling for AMD CEO, Hector Ruiz, to resign, AMD has chugged along and quietly released its next generation mobile CPU + graphics platform--PUMA.
Puma has definitely impressed critics. It is being featured in a brand new laptop from HP (NYSE:HPQ) called the dv5z. Here is an excerpt from a review of the laptop by
NotebookReview.com
In short, AMD and ATI just murdered the low-end dedicated graphics card market. There's absolutely no reason to buy a laptop with a low-end dedicated graphics card like the NVIDIA 8400m GS because the new ATI integrated graphics solution performs just as well (if not better) at a fraction of the cost.
One would imagine that weakness in Nvidia due to competition might mean an uptick in AMD's share price. That isn't the case. AMD, although doing well in the graphics department, is still lagging Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in CPU technology. AMD's next generation PUMA actually consumes more battery life than before. This is a huge no-no for laptops, which already don't stay on long enough (mine is about to run out of batteries as we speak!)
Furthermore, AMD recently released its top of the line desktop CPU to very little fan fare. The title of the article from Engadget says it all:
AMD's flagship Phenom X4 9950 BE announced: Intel laughs, points
As you'd hope from AMD's flagship desktop CPU, the X4 9950 is faster across the board than the previous AMD title holder, the X4 9850, albeit, just 5%.
AMD continues to lag Intel in terms of performance per watt as well.
Another very logical conclusion is that because of AMD's continued underperformance in the CPU market, Intel might find strength in its stock. That's also false.
The overall conclusion? Chip makers is not where you want to be right now, as an investor. Competition = lower share prices for all that are involved.
But for consumers, and the rest of the world AMD should serve as a reminder of what competition really means. Cheaper toys for everyone!

2008-07-20,"""Uninspiring"" is never a word a company wants associated with its performance or its executive changes--or anything, for that matter. But it's an apt description, used in a report Friday by Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Srini Pajjuri to describe microprocessor maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMD) second-quarter financial results and the appointment of a new CEO.
The struggling chipmaker said late Thursday that it will replace CEO Hector Ruiz with president and chief operating officer Dirk Meyer. Ruiz, who will remain executive chairman, has led AMD since 2002, when he took the reins from flamboyant founder Jerry Sanders. Under Ruiz's leadership, the company did have a few big wins against its arch-enemy, Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC). Its Opteron chips, for example, helped it gain a strong foothold in enterprise computing.
But it's been a tough run for AMD over the past couple years. Product stumbles and the 2006 acquisition of graphics processor maker ATI Technologies Inc. have helped drive the company's stock price to new lows. AMD paid $5.4 billion to purchase of ATI; analysts considered that price much too high, and that belief has been borne out by several goodwill writedowns, the latest of which was announced last week and brought the total charges against the deal to $2.56 billion.
As an article in the Wall Street Journal points out, AMD's market cap is far below what it paid for ATI a couple years ago. The company yesterday posted second-quarter revenue of $1.35 billion, a 10% decline from the previous quarter. This missed Merrill Lynch's forecast, and AMD also announced third quarter guidance below Merrill's expectations, Pajjuri wrote.
As for bringing in a new CEO, this seemed like a perfect opportunity to shake AMD up, kind of like Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE:HPQ) wisely bringing in new blood by tapping Mark Hurd as its new chief.
But for incoming AMD CEO Meyer, a 12-year veteran of the chipmaker, the general thought is that the company is in for more of the same.
""While the CEO change could bring in a new perspective, we do not expect any drastic changes in the near term,"" Pajjuri wrote.
Wall Street seemed to agree Friday morning. Shares of AMD plunged 12%, to $4.66. Uninspiring, indeed."
2008-07-21,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) may be trading well off of its 52-week highs, but it is not going out of business anytime soon. The leading manufacturer of semiconductors has experienced hardships along with the rest of the industry as consumer spending has declined, reducing sales and putting pressure on margins.
Investors Looking to Get in
Conservative investors looking to establish a position in AMD have two options: (1) They can purchase a stake in AMD and hope the downside is over, or (2) they can purchase long-term LEAPS to take advantage of the upside at a fraction of the cost. Let's take a look at both options and see which one makes more sense…
Purchasing a 100 share block of the underlying stock would cost an investor $465 and involve taking on dollar-for-dollar risk until the stock is sold. However, a $5 Jan ‘10 LEAPS call options contract can be purchased for around $181 and enable the investor to realize gains whenever AMD rises above $6.81 anytime before January of 2010.
AMD is a very volatile stock with a beta of 2.69, which makes its options relatively expensive. However, consider that if the underlying drops another 60% - just a fraction of its drop this year - you could be down just as much as the LEAPS anyway ($181 in the red). With LEAPS, your loss is capped at just the $181 you paid for the options.
Conversely, if the stock returns to $16 per share, the LEAPS will make nearly 900% while the underlying shares will only make nearly 350% return. Investors that are bullish on the stock beyond a ~23% annual return should consider LEAPS as an alternative to purchase stock as it caps the risk and amplifies the returns.
Investors Sitting on Losses
Investors that are sitting on losses may just want to get out of AMD as quickly as possible. These investors also have two options: (1) They can double down and halve their breakeven point, or (2) they can use LEAPS to reduce their breakeven point for free. The downside with the LEAPS is that they give up any substantial upside.
The LEAPS repair strategy works by purchasing one $5 Jan ‘10 LEAPS option and writing two $7.50 Jan ‘10 options. The resulting position is one that will give you $56 to setup and potentially get you out of completely out of AMD at $7.50 if the stock rises that high. However, your breakeven point is now lower as well, depending on your initial cost.
Closing Remarks
It is important to keep in mind that both of these strategies require the belief that AMD shares will recover. After all, if you don’t hold this belief, then you should have already sold!

2015-03-03,"On Monday, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) announced Mantle is being repositioned as essentially a platform that game developers should avoid, while recommending they use GLnext or DX12. Instead, they will be using it as a ""graphics innovation platform,"" apparently to do what it already has - push other APIs forward, while having little market presence itself.
The net result is pretty simple: Mantle will have essentially no direct relevance to end-users, although indirectly it is clearly responsible for the improvement in GLnext and DX12. If you are an AMD investor, this sure seems like AMD wasted a lot of money while commanding absolutely no market advantage. If you're an NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) investor, you've once again seen AMD ineptitude and weakness prevent a successful resolution to their ""revolutionary"" technology.
This is the perspective I have been arguing against since Mantle has come out, because most people see the obvious more easily than the actual. The actual winner is AMD, the loser is Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), although the magnitude of the victory is quite minor. NVIDIA is probably largely unchanged, gaining in some respects, and losing in others.
First, the move by AMD to diminish the role of Mantle might disgust some investors, but it was made inevitable by the fact it held few advantages over GLnext and DX12. There simply was no point to it with those two effectively duplicating the advantages of it, while being much more significant standards. Also, Mantle accomplished what AMD wanted, just not what people thought they wanted.
This was to pop Intel's tire, not NVIDIA's. Anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of the CPU market knows that AMD is catastrophically behind Intel's ""big"" processors in performance. These are the processors that are primarily used in gaming machines. AMD is still staggering from the failure of this line, and AMD investors are still lying to themselves about products like Carrizo. In reality, AMD's small processors have kept the company in business, while the large ones drag the company into the abyss.
This is not to discount AMD's new found failure in GPUs, or the thrashing they took in Q4 of 2014. The difference is, AMD's failure in big CPUs has become an addiction, whereas in GPUs, they certainly enjoy indulging in it, but just as often swing the pendulum the opposite way and achieve success.
Many were hoping Mantle would give AMD an advantage in GPUs, when in reality it will not. However, it does make Intel's advantage in CPUs far less relevant in these scenarios. Even before this, it was largely accepted that with most games, the buyer should favor spending more on the GPU than the CPU. GLNext and DX12 will certainly push that tendency further, generating more money for the GPU makers, and less for Intel. This also makes it more likely the buyer will choose an AMD processor, since they will have adequate performance in more scenarios.
But the more major benefit for AMD will come for the APUs. No one can question that AMD's CPUs there are the weaker part of the design, with the GPUs the stronger part. Equally, Intel's CPU, despite two disappointments, are still clearly superior, while their GPUs are inefficient and poor. Intel backers can point to the Iris Pro line as having a powerful iGPU, but it is a brute force approach that is expensive to implement. This is why Intel uses it in few designs. By comparison, AMD's mainstream parts easily surpass those of Intel's in GPU performance. Shifting the focus to the GPU, which DX12 and GLnext do, can only benefit AMD.
Furthermore, it does improve absolute performance of games on APUs, making more parts ""good enough,"" although I suspect this would not be a very significant amount. But, even a small percentage can be helpful to AMD, even if it also implies they would not sell a discrete card. Of course, this would have a negative effect on NVIDIA, and more on Intel if it implied the buyer bought an AMD part instead of an Intel one.
So, while the appearance of Mantle having done little for AMD is likely the picture for most, it's not an accurate one. It achieved what AMD wanted, and will benefit the company. However, it's critical to keep it in perspective and not believe the release of DX12 will cause a noticeable shift in market dynamics in favor of AMD. It's going to be quite slight. It will also be enduring. With new APU designs in 2016, the advantages of new APIs could be more significant if the products are more competitive to begin with. When you're AMD, and in their situation, this is success.

2015-03-05,"Overview:
During the last 10-year period, AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) price has varied by a factor of 20 from over 41 in 2006, to as low as 1.80 in 2008. It hasn't closed above 10 since 2010, or even above 5 since 2012. Its history is littered with the detritus of bad decisions and ugly products and at this moment, it is clearly on the ropes. So it follows that, in order to go the other direction toward $10, it must make excellent decisions and deliver new products that people want to buy.
In this article, we will look toward 2017 to find the differences between AMD's recent past and the next two years. Then we will show how those differences will drive higher profits and a $10 stock price. In the end, AMD will get off the ropes and will win by a knockout.
AMD is now ""fabless"" just like ARM Holdings (ARM) and will remain so.
In the past AMD has invested huge amounts in fabs. Now that Global Foundries has taken over the fabs, the huge capex required for fabs is eliminated. AMD has kept its Test and Assembly facilities.
By maintaining its own T&A function, AMD can expand its margins a few points without any massive CAPEX commitment. From Devinder Kumar, CFO:
We have backend facilities where we make the product in-house assembly and test bases, extract more costs, what I will say to you is they're up from the mid-teens from an operating margin standpoint and that can only get better as we move through the cycle. Future acquisitions, if any, will be small tuck-ins like Sea-Micro.
We will not see any more large acquisitions like ATI from AMD. Sea-micro was a $335 million purchase vs. ATI's $5 billion. Items 1, 2 and 3 show the new increased focus on managing capital going forward. New CEO puts focus on engineering and product delivery.
New CEO Lisa Su has a Ph.D. in EE and has 20 years experience delivering new semiconductor products at Freescale (NYSE:FSL) and IBM(NYSE:IBM). Between now and 2017, it is imperative that AMD deliver on the products promised (embedded, SoC and x86) and Su's experience in this area is critical. Previous CEO Rory Read was a great business manager but not an engineer, so this transition at the top is timely. Hiring three of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) top chip designers bodes well for AMD's future.
Jim Keller designed AMD's Athlon 64, which in 2006, helped AMD almost get to 50% of the desktop market. He left AMD, ended up at Apple and is now back with AMD. Keller lends confidence that AMD's new x86 products will be serious competitors to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s designs. Raja Koduri came to AMD via the ATI acquisition, then left for Apple. Now he's back and will head up the graphics GPU side of AMD. They both report to former Apple Engineering VP, Mark Papermaster. One thing Apple knows is how to deliver saleable products on time.
When top talent like these three hire on to a struggling company, they must believe very strongly that things can be turned around. That gives me confidence too, because these three guys certainly know more about AMD's future prospects than I do. New chips will allow market share expansion into the high-margin server market.
In 2006, AMD had 25% of the server market, now it's down to 3%. How big are the margins in server chips? Intel's Data Center Group had $7.2 billion in Operating Income in 2014, almost $2 billion higher than AMD's total sales. If you want to know how you get such huge results from 97% market share, just take a look at the Top 10 server chips from AMD compared to Intel. Note that even with the huge disparity in price, AMD could not get past 3% market share. That tells me the current Opterons are vastly inferior products. But with 97% share, Intel is very vulnerable to any competitive product AMD can come up with. Imagine where AMD will be if it can even get its share up to 15%.
Opteron vs. Xeon Pricing

7. Game consoles have a lot more sales coming and their margins are improving.
The game console semi-custom SoC (System on a Chip) has saved AMD from oblivion. I cannot imagine the company would still be alive without that business. Well, AMD is alive and game consoles have a long, long way to run. As you can see, sales of the previous generation did not peak until year six which would be 2017. And by the way, AMD is increasing the console margins too.
When asked specifically whether AMD could increase its console chip margins to over 20 percent, Mr. Kumar (AMD CFO) answered positively.
Bravo.
8. Internet of Things (IOT) means big CAGR for AMD's embedded chips.
Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) says the number of devices connected to the internet will double between 2015 and 2020 to 50 billion. Boeing (NYSE:BA) for example has 8,000-10,000 sensors on every aircraft. Many of these devices will be connected by embedded processors, a special expertise of AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su.
Prior to joining AMD, Dr. Su served as senior vice president and general manager, Networking and Multimedia at Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., and was responsible for global strategy, marketing and engineering for the company's embedded communications and applications processor business.
9. Windows on ARM processors will happen long before 2017.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has Windows on the smallest phones and the largest servers. But what about the huge market using ARM processors in between those two bookends? From a business standpoint, I don't see how MSFT can just abandon it to arch enemy Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Android. We know this would be an easy transition, since they already have Windows on ARM with the Surface RT. When Windows on ARM happens who will be best positioned to handle it? My vote goes to AMD with its long experience with x86 and its Skybridge project of one pin compatible chipset for both 64 bit ARM and x86 processors.
10. Modest sales growth and margin expansion will easily lead to profits and a $10 price.
With all the new products coming on-line over the next two years, I see AMD's sales expanding easily to $7 billion from $5.5 B in 2014, with a Gross margin of 40% instead of 2014's lousy 33%. But to be even more conservative, let's also do $6.5 B in sales (same as 2011) and 38% in GM (44% in 2011). Let's also remove the one-time charge for 2014 and hope it doesn't reoccur over the next three years. If AMD does anywhere near these numbers, the stock may be well above $10.
AMD Projections 2014-2017 in billions 2014 Actual 2016-17 Projected 2016-17 Projected Sales 5.51 7 6.5 GM 33% 40% 38% Gross Income 1.83 2.8 2.47 SGA 1.66 1.9 1.9 Unusual expense 0.379 0 0 Interest 0.177 0.19 0.19 Pretax Income -0.386 0.71 0.38 Fully Diluted Shares 0.733 0.733 0.733 Earnings Pre-tax -0.53 0.97 0.52 Source: Author and Marketwatch
Could there be an IBM/AMD connection sometime in the next two years?
IBM and AMD have a connection via Global Foundries which bought AMD's fabs earlier this decade and bought IBM's fabs just last fall. GF will be making IBM chips such as the Power8 which is vastly more powerful than anything AMD has. IBM has opened the architecture and other IP of the power8 to members of the Open Power Consortium Group including Google, Rackspace and Tyan. AMD has many engineers capable of exploiting the IP and micro-code of the power8, should AMD decide there's a market for the combined product. Instead of ARM and x86 chips on the same board, why not power8 and ARM or power8 and x86? This is a long-shot for sure, but intriguing nonetheless. And by the way, IBM has an agreement with Nvidia, so why not AMD?
Opteron Power Series anyone?
Conclusion:
At a current price of $3, AMD stock is like a long-term LEAP without an expiration date. Based upon the 10 points above, I see very little downside to AMD unless the company just fail to execute on its plan. But that's a risk with every investment. The company has survived this long without any significant new products, but by 2017, it should have several and the result should be higher margins, profits and a much higher stock price. I am long AMD stock.

2015-03-10,"Owing to a decline in PC shipments, market share losses to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and a late entry in new emerging markets, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) saw its revenue base shrink in 2012 and 2013. The company completed its restructuring phase in 2013, which helped it regain its growth momentum in 2014 by successfully ramping up a diverse set of new products. AMD witnessed a 4% annual growth in revenue last year. Combined with an 11% reduction in operating expenses, the revenue growth helped the company deliver its first full year of non-GAAP profitability since 2011. An important part of AMD's restructuring strategy was to derive 40%-50% share of its revenue by 2015 from high growth markets, including semi-custom and ultra-low power processors, professional graphics processors, as well as processors for dense server and embedded solutions. The company claims to be on track to achieve this goal.
AMD devised a unified gaming strategy in March 2013 that addresses its plan to drive the gaming market across consoles, cloud platforms, tablets and PCs. The company powers all major next generation consoles, including Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 4, Nintendo's (OTCPK:NTDOY) Wii U and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One. 2014 was the first full year of semi-custom game console shipments, and this was an important factor in AMD deriving approximately 40% of its revenue from high growth markets. The company supplied significant amount of products to Microsoft and Sony in Q3 2014 as these companies ramped up production to support the holiday demand spike. More than 30 million Sony and Microsoft consoles have been shipped since their launch, which helped AMD ship more than double the number of semi-custom chips in 2014 compared to 2013.
After a 14-year ban, China legalized the sale of home video game consoles early last year. Microsoft already has started selling the Xbox One in the country. In this article, we discuss how legalizing the sale of game consoles in China can benefit AMD.
Our price estimate of $3.76 for AMD is at a considerable premium to the current market price.
Background
China banned the sale of video game consoles back in 2000 as the government considered it to be a corrupting influence on the nation's children. On January 6, 2014, the State Council of the People's Republic of China announced that it had officially lifted a ban on video game consoles which are produced in Shanghai's new free trade zone. According to Bloomberg, though, that restriction will soon be lifted and game companies will be free to make and sell their consoles anywhere in the Middle Kingdom. [1] However, the Ministry of Culture's restrictive content rules mean that most of the global gaming world's top console hits will never make it to Chinese systems. And at the same time, the most popular game genres and titles in China (mostly PC-based multi-user online) just are not compatible with consoles.
Analysts at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP estimated that console makers could be looking at a $10 billion video game industry in China, opening the doors for an entirely new market for Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. [2] Even gamers who own previous generation consoles will appreciate the new opportunity to connect to other console users in the new legal market segment. Being the most populous country in the world, China is now the biggest market in the world for consumer electronics. According to Microsoft's Yusuf Mehdi there are more than half a billion gamers in the country.
Microsoft's Xbox One, which was released last fall, starting selling in China from day one. After its release late in Mainland China, the Xbox One sold over 100,000 units. But since then the console has faced criticism from Chinese consumers, as well as government interference with its online video streaming partner. [3] In September 2014, Microsoft invested $240 million in a joint venture with BesTV, a domestic technology company. [4]
The PS4 is expected to launch in China in the near future, but Sony has yet to make an official announcement. Nintendo is planning to launch a custom console specifically intended for the Chinese market.
Game Consoles Now Account For A Minuscule Part of The Chinese Gaming Market
According to Reuters, China is the world's third-largest video game market in terms of revenue and the vast majority of the money in China's gaming market comes from PC games. The absence of consoles has left PC games with almost two-thirds of the market, according to data released at the annual China games industry conference in December. Browser gaming accounts for just over 15% and mobile gaming nearly 14%. [5] Revenues from console gaming made up just 0.1% of China's total gaming market in 2013.
With consoles still to establish a mainstream presence, Microsoft's entry gives it the chance to make its Xbox brand synonymous with console gaming and living room entertainment. Lisa Hanson is the founder of Niko Partners, which specializes in analyzing the Asian video games market. She believes that consoles may become popular if there's strong marketing to promote the merits of console gaming. However, the high cost of game consoles can be a deterring factor. More than 70% of Chinese gamers earn less than 4,000 yuan ($634) a month, according to Hong Kong-based brokerage CLSA. The new Xbox One sells for nearly $500 in the United States, while Sony's PlayStation 4 sells for approximately $400. New games for each console cost around $60.
AMD Is Already Reaping The Benefits Of Game Console Sales In China
Despite the ban, game consoles were available for sale illegally in China through the gray market for many years. Between 2002-2009, an estimated 1.2 million units of consoles were sold illegally every year in the country. Although these sales have benefited console makers they have been missing out on not only a higher volume of unit sales, but on additional revenue streams which bolster profits in other markets. Now that consoles are legal to own, the manufacturers will be able to make more money through advertising, promotions, and marketing to foster sales of legally distributed games, which also offer the ability to connect to other consoles online. Once console sales ramp in sufficient numbers, AMD's APUs and GPUs will ship in volumes far exceeding the millions of illegal consoles sold in the Chinese gray market.
In sum, the Chinese console market is an untapped opportunity, and its opening should significantly spur global game console sales in the future. If consoles gain popularity among Chinese gamers, and are able to capture even 10% of the gaming population in the country (that is, 10% of 500 million gamers), it will still be a significant jump from the current level. AMD will benefit from higher revenues from console sales without increasing its R&D or marketing costs.

2015-03-19,"Licensing Radeon and other AMD assets to third-party companies is a great way to ride the boom in smartphone/tablet sales.
If the rumor is true, AMD will get a strong boost from MediaTek's pervasive presence in smartphones and tablets.
Rumor has it that one of the world's biggest names in mobile chips, MediaTek, is interested in licensing the Radeon GPU technology of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). If this proves true, AMD will have another chance to benefit from the continuing surge in sales of smartphones and tablets.
I opine that AMD made a mistake in selling its mobile GPU assets to Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) in 2009. Qualcomm paid just $65 million to acquire AMD's Handheld or Imageon graphics division. Qualcomm definitely used the graphics IP acquired from AMD to improve its integrated GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) technology for mobile devices.
Qualcomm renamed the Imageon brand to Adreno - which became the embedded GPU for all of its Snapdragon mobile processors. Licensing the Imageon assets to Qualcomm and other OEMs could have netted AMD more than $65 million (due to the massive spike in sales of smartphones and tablets since 2009).
Hundreds of millions of Android Windows phones used Qualcomm's Snapdragon/Adreno SoC.
Holding on to its Handheld Graphics division could have helped AMD get more money to pay off the massive debt it incurred when it bought ATI in 2006.
MediaTek Needs Radeon
The Imageon Handheld division was also acquired from ATI Technologies. Licensing the Radeon GPU assets to MediaTek could help make up for AMD's previous lack of foresight with Imageon's potential.
Smartphones and tablets are emerging as favored gaming gadgets. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm , and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), are all coming out with more powerful integrated GPUs to make mobile devices come out with console-quality graphics performance.
MediaTek's dependence on ARM Holdings' (NASDAQ:ARMH) Mali GPU technology will not help it compete with the likes of the Nvidia Tegra X1. AMD proved that its Radeon graphics platform is at par with Nvidia's PC GPU products. MediaTek therefore needs access to Radeon's IP to help it remain competitive with Qualcomm and Nvidia.
Qualcomm's buyout of AMD's Handheld graphics division helped it escape from the cheap but limited Mali GPU architecture. The Adreno 430 GPU of the Snapdragon 810 SoC has higher benchmark test scores than the Mali-T760 GPU of the Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) Galaxy Note 4.

The chart above should be sufficient explanation why MediaTek needs AMD's Radeon technology. MediaTek wants to push its mobile chips inside more high-end phones. The key to winning more premium phone customers might be a more powerful GPU inside MediaTek's premium octa-core processors.
MediaTek is using PowerVR GX6250 GPU inside its newest MT8173 64-bit ARM Cortex-72 based tablet SoC. However, MediaTek's rumored interest over AMD's Radeon technology could mean that, like Qualcomm, it wants more control over its GPU design. Creating custom GPUs could help MediaTek improve its high-end mobile processors' graphics performance.
AMD Proved It Can Create Radeon-powered Energy Efficient Mobile Processors
Before Intel released its 4.5-watt TDP Core M processors, AMD already proved early last year that an x86 mobile application processor could hit a TDP of only 3.95 Watts. AMD's 1GHz dual-core Mullins E-1 Micro-6200T mobile applications processor (with 3.95 Watts TDP and Radeon R2 graphics) offered decent entry-level desktop-like graphics performance that's comparable to less energy efficient integraphic graphics processors from Intel and Nvidia.

I argued last year that Beema/Mullins' low TDP made them ideal for tablets. Unfortunately, AMD never landed a design win from any major tablet manufacturers. This is where MediaTek could step in and help AMD. Unlike AMD, MediaTek is not burdened by heavy debt payments. It has the marketing money to attract OEMs to try Radeon-powered octa-core processors.
Last year's Beema/Mullins APUs had a max core count of four. However, incorporating GCN and HSA-optimized Radeon R3 or R4 graphics could play well with MediaTek's expertise with octa-core mobile application processors. The important thing is that MediaTek can build on the impressive energy efficiency of AMD's game-centric Beema APU design.

Conclusion
My ideal scenario is for Qualcomm to buy AMD. However, an alliance with MediaTek could still be significant help toward AMD's future growth (or survival?). The Radeon graphics technology plays well with MediaTek's need for a custom mobile graphics processors.
MediaTek, not Intel, is being touted to be the biggest threat to Qualcomm's pole position in mobile chips. The Neowin article extolling the many virtues of MediaTek's octa-core processors shared my misgivings over the weak GPU components. Licensing the Radeon graphics assets is therefore of utmost importance to MediaTek.
Buying AMD's entire GPU business might even be better for MediaTek. This Taiwanese fabless chips vendor is not content competing with Qualcomm. MediaTek also aims to challenge Intel's grip on Chromebooks. Intel chips power most Chromebooks available in the market today.
Nvidia managed to convince Acer to put a Tegra K1 ARM-based processor inside the Chromebook 3. Integrating Radeon graphics with the 64-bit Helion X10 could help MediaTek's pitch to Chrome OS computer makers.
The benefits to AMD (if it really lands the Radeon deal with MediaTek) could be as important as its win with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles. MediaTek proved it can outplay Qualcomm in low-to-midrange mobile processors. A Radeon GPU for MediaTek's high-end but (still cheaper than Snapdragon 810) octa-core processors may also inspire more OEMs to abandon Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800 series chips.
I will rate AMD a Buy if it really closes the Radeon licensing deal with MediaTek. My previous mistake of assuming that AMD (like Intel) could still benefit from a surge in PC sales was a bad bet. I now believe that AMD's PC processor business has little chance of improving against Intel's onslaught. AMD is unlikely to repeat its 2006 glory days.
The GPU business, smartphones, and tablet markets look more promising. The more third-party companies that buys or licenses Radeon, the better it is for AMD. The ATI acquisition left AMD with an almost crippling debt that is still punishing the company. I can only hope that the Radeon assets would eventually turn out to be AMD's saving grace.

2015-03-12,"Overview:
In my last article on March 5, 2015, I gave 10 reasons why AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) would be at least $10/share in 2017. Recent news has shown that at least two more reasons have been added to the original 10.
In this updated follow-on article I will explain why these two announcements make my ""$10 by 2017"" thesis even more viable now than it was on March 5th. And we will cover the concerns about AMD debt too.
Sony PlayStation 4 in China is huge
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One was released in China in Sept. 2014 with a limit of 5 million boxes. One would have to assume Sony (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation's limit would be the same so that is an additional 10 million AMD console SoC sales not considered in my previous estimates. Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY) also is considering releasing their latest console in China but has not finalized their decision yet.
There are two main issues facing console manufacturers in China. First is the widespread theft of IP by the Chinese including software, movies and yes video games. The second reason is China's ""10 Rules for Censorship"" that limit console game content.
That being said as you might guess the market in China is potentially the largest in the world.
Top 10 Country Rankings based on Game Revenues | 2014 Estimates COUNTRY POPULATION INTERNET TOTAL REVENUES POPULATION IN US DOLLARS China 1,393,783,836 701,073,270 17,866,677,000 United States 322,583,006 274,292,330 20,484,628,000 India 1,267,401,849 223,062,725 307,909,000 Brazil 202,033,670 118,593,764 1,339,375,000 Japan 126,999,808 101,663,346 12,219,552,000 Russian Federation 142,467,651 88,059,255 1,143,197,000 Nigeria 178,516,904 74,584,362 152,824,000 Germany 82,652,256 71,080,940 3,528,196,000 France 64,641,279 56,237,913 2,608,818,000 Mexico 123,799,215 56,130,564 1,006,072,000 SOURCE: newzoo.com
So using a 10 million unit sales number for Xbox and PS4 (ignoring possible Nintendo sales) and assuming a conservative $80 per unit value to AMD we are looking at $800 million in revenue. And how long will it take to sell 10 million consoles in China? Well I would think with an internet population of 700 million - less than a year. And if all goes well then I would assume another 5 million tranche would follow soon after. Note that India is another large relatively untapped market for consoles.
liquidVR shows AMD is in the Virtual Reality business too.
Virtual reality is another line-of-business with a huge CAGR (39.2%) thru 2019. Remember AMD sales are only 1/10th the size of Intel and a $500 million piece of the VR market by 2017 would be big for AMD but small potatoes for someone like Intel. With liquidVR, developers have an SDK (Software Development Kit) that will allow them to more closely control the head movement and other gestures of VR users. Potential users are medical, real estate and education in addition to the more recognizable markets of gaming and entertainment. liquidVR allows the coordination of multiple CPUs and GPUs on the same application to provide the power needed for heavy VR users. This is one more source of future revenue enhancement between now and 2017.
What about the debt issue?
Many comments on my previous AMD article have mentioned, usually negatively, the $2.025 billion long-term debt. But in reality there's no debt due until 2019 and my thesis is based on earnings by 2017. Debt will not be an issue until at least 2018 and then only if AMD has not made significant progress on the earnings front.
Also as of 12/31/2014 AMD has over $1 billion in cash so paying off or refinancing a $600 million debt in 2019 should be doable. By the way interest costs have actually dropped since 2011 from $190 million to $177 million. I don't see a big problem with AMD's debt unless of course they don't have any earnings. Then it is a big problem.
From 2014 Annual 10-K:
Future Payments on Total Debt
As of December 27, 2014, the company's future debt and capital lease payment obligations were as follows:
Long Term Debt (Principal only) Short Term Debt (Principal only) Capital Leases (In millions) 2015 $ - $ 172 $ 5 2016 - - 6 2017 - - 1 2018 - - - 2019 600 - - 2020 and thereafter 1,425 - - Total 2,025 172 12 Less: imputed interest - - - Total $ 2,025 $ 172 $ 12
Conclusion:
Recent news for AMD is very good and adds two more reasons to my original 10 for why AMD will be $10 by 2017. And taking a close look at the AMD debt situation shows no immediate issues and no long-term issues if they turn a decent profit.

2015-03-19,"If Nvidia can get away with a $299 gaming tablet, AMD could also market the Radeon R6-powered Mullins A10-6700 SoC as a game-centric SoC for Windows 10 and Android 5.0.
Since Carizzo is not qualified for fanless tablets and notebooks, last year’s Mullins APU remains AMD’s hope for tablets.
I can understand why Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to ignore the fast-growing Chromebook industry. Mark Papermaster, Chief Technology officer of AMD, explained that Chromebooks are not high-margin products. Papermaster also believes Chrome OS computers are now fit for AMD's graphics-driven APU products. AMD will not stoop down to selling $7 processors for $200 Chromebooks.
AMD's allergy to low-margin processors made Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) the big winner of the rapid increase in sales of Chromebooks last year. Intel also sold more than 46 million tablet application processors in 2014. Intel is using contra revenue to push itself to becoming the no.2 tablet processor supplier, just behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Unfortunately, AMD does not have the money to match Intel's contra revenue-driven tablet strategy. However, I insist that AMD's new CEO should heed the example set by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Since Xiaomi is the only major tablet vendor to use Tegra K1, Nvidia simply released the $299 Nvidia Shield gaming tablet last year.
Tablet Gaming Is Besting Console Gaming
AMD's future, in my opinion, would be better if the company starts adjusting its tactics. Yes, there is no money in selling Radeon-powered Chromebooks but there is good money to be made in selling gaming tablets. Lisa Su cannot rely on console sales to keep AMD afloat for very long. The Radeon assets should expand its total addressable market to include tablets and smartphones.
Look at the chart below, Newzoo says tablet gaming is the fastest growing segment at 37% year-over-year growth in 2014. There are now 527 million gamers who use tablets, and 1.27 billion people who use their phones.
The console games industry that helped AMD last year is on a downward trend. Even China's decision to allow game console sales will not be enough to reverse the pattern.
Source: Statista
The sad chart above has inspired game console pioneer Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY) to branch out to mobile gaming. AMD should heed this warning - console gaming is deteriorating. Tablet or mobile gaming is where AMD's Radeon assets could find a new growth driver.
AMD Has The Assets To Be A Force In Tablet Gaming
I previously discussed that MediaTek might license Radeon technology. However, AMD should be more pro-active like Nvidia. I know that AMD has little money to gamble on an in-house game-centric tablet like Nvidia could. However, BlackBerry's (NASDAQ:BBRY) John Chen solved this inventory risk by outsourcing to Foxconn. Nokia (NYSE:NOK) did it too with its N1 Android tablet.
AMD has a bad habit of making prototypes of its products but never following up with a real product. Being meek against the overbearing presence of Intel is no way for Dr. Lisa Su to cure the ailing AMD enterprise. Yes, Intel dominates the tablet OEMs but it did not stop Nvidia from releasing its own tablet.
Papermaster's explanation that there is little money to be made on Chromebooks is a paper tiger excuse that does not apply to games-centric tablets. Logic says Nvidia is not losing money on the $299 Shield Tablet. Xiaomi is selling the Tegra K1-powered MiPad Android tablet for $200 in India.
The Nokia N1 tablet, which is games-worthy, also retails for less than $250 in China. AMD has a tablet gaming-perfect APU in Mullins A10-6700T. The 4.5 TDP rating of the quad-core A10-6700T allows it to be used in fanless tablets and superthin notebooks like Intel's Core-M.
Mullins' Radeon R6 GPU is not as powerful as the Tegra K1 but Mullins is more efficient because the Tegra K1 has a TDP rating of 11W. The GPU benchmark scores of the A10-6700T Mullins still delivers eye-candy numbers though. Please study the charts below, the 28-nanometer Mullins is a better games-centric processor than the 22-nanometer Intel Atom Z3770 SoCs.
Source of Images: HotHardware
Conclusion
Microsoft will release Windows 10 this coming summer. The 4.5Watt Mullins APU might be the perfect SoC for sub-$300 games-centric Windows 10 tablets. Lisa Su might be able to persuade many of the white-box tablet manufacturers in Shenzhen, China to try the Mullins A10-6700T to make a Windows 10 clone of the Nvidia Shield Android tablet.
The AMD A10-6700T has found its way to the enterprise-centric 10.1-inch $500 Photon 2 Windows tablet last October. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) also used a Mullins SoC for the touchscreen-enabled HP Pavilion 10z last year. AMD should not abandon the tablet processor market. Tablet sales are outpacing the notebook sales. The new Carizzo APUs will find it hard to win the low-cost notebook category in the face of Intel's contra revenue tactics on laptops and 2-in-1s.
AMD needs to emulate Nvidia's tactic of creating a niche in higher-priced games-centric tablets. The Mullins APU can run Linux so I hope Dr. Lisa Su will soon allow the Mullins family of APUs to be used on Android tablets or smartphones. Kitguru said Mullins failed to attract the support of OEMs because it did not support Android.
The Android OS support issue is not really important for Windows game-centric tablets. Any Windows 8.1 tablet with 2GB of RAM or more will be able to run Android OS emulators like BlueStacks and Console OS. The most important thing is for Dr. Lisa Su deliver a real commercial AMD Mullins-powered tablet, not just a prototype like the Project Discovery.
Persuading tablet manufacturers cannot be accomplished through creating reference designs alone. Nvidia had the balls to come up with a game-centric tablet. I'd like to find out if Mr. Papermaster and Dr. Su are brave enough to gamble on the surging trend toward tablet and mobile gaming.
There are three highly-paid analysts at TipRanks who rates AMD as a Buy. However, the algorithm engine predicts of I KnowFirst says AMD has a bearish 30-day signal of -4.74. I KnowFirst says it might be best for people to find other investment opportunities.
I'm a gamer. The potential of Mullins for tablets makes me believe that AMD is still worth a small bet.

2015-03-27,"Introduction
On Wednesday, Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) shares fell nearly 6% on a downgrade issued by UBS due to the expectation of a soft PC market for 2015. Last year, the PC market showed an unexpectedly strong resistance to the heavy declines that plagued many previous years, but unfortunately for AMD this was thanks to an uptick in demand from the commercial side, a sector that AMD is under-indexed in. Going into 2015, IDC predicts PC sales will be worse than originally anticipated, and even Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has showed that its record revenues are coming to an end by shedding nearly a billion dollars off of its former Q1 revenue guidance. The immediate future looks catastrophic for AMD, but is there a glimmer of hope and should you act upon it?
Weakening PC market unexpectedly continues
Over the last few years, the PC market has been tough, and coming out of last year's better than expected results, many were beginning to believe that 2015 would also only lightly taper off. However, earlier this month, Intel hacked nearly a billion dollars (WSJ registration required at link) off of its first quarter revenue outlook, which is now set for roughly $12.8 billion. Furthermore, research firm IDC has recently reported that 2015 will likely be worse than previously thought. The research firm now predicts that global shipments of PCs will decline by 4.9% this year to 293.1M units, a bigger dip than its formerly forecasted 3.3% decline. On a dollar basis, IDC reported that 2014's PC sales fell by 0.8% to $201B, however, for 2015 it is predicted to fall another 6.9%. Going even further beyond, the research firm believes that the situation will progressively worsen to $175 billion in 2019, representing a 13% decline from 2014's figures. (same link)
AMD's Q1 and a glimmer of hope
When I initially covered AMD's unexpectedly bad Q4, I had a hard time getting over the idea that the first quarter would be far worse. Through most of 2014, we witnessed only small sequential changes in the company's revenue, but AMD reported that it is expecting to start the year off with a 15% decline to about $1.05B in revenue, which will possibly be the lowest seen in decades
In spite of the ill guidance, AMD assured many investors with confidence by blaming that the declines would only be temporary as the culprit of the decline, inventory issues, would be resolved by the end of Q1. Furthermore, AMD has showed confidence in its new lineup of mobile APUs, Carrizo and Carrizo-L, stating that they would help bring growth in Q2 due to their power efficiency achievements that were made in spite of the usage of old transistor technology. Later on in the year, investors and consumers should be excited about an all-new refresh of AMD's lineup of graphics processors that have showed impressive results in both power efficiency and performance in a variety of unconfirmed leaks, as I previously covered. AMD's graphics chips are long overdue for an upgrade, as Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) parts are crushing AMD on all fronts.
Unfortunately, AMD is annoyingly tightlipped about everything and the company hasn't even given us an updated roadmap for the near future. However, this confidence in second quarter growth has assured many investors for the chipmaker's stock actually saw a considerable uplift following its unappealing fourth quarter earnings report and first quarter guidance in January.
Conclusion
There is no doubt that AMD is an ultra-risky and highly unpredictable stock that has failed to make many investors such as myself very happy. However, as I have said repeatedly, my money is in the game with the hope that AMD will one day restore itself and reverse its decline entirely. As the PC sales continue their inevitable decline in the future, we see AMD diversify itself out of the PC space. Last year, AMD's PC-based revenue only accounted for 40% of its overall revenue and this figure is expected to be roughly 50% by the end of this year. AMD has entered new markets, such as professional graphics, gaming consoles, embedded solutions, ARM servers, and more. Most of these sectors have already shown double-digit growth and AMD is confident about the future of these businesses.
In the near term, we will witness AMD struggle as it attempts to end its revenue declines with products such as Carrizo, Carrizo-L, and a new lineup of GPUs, but further beyond the situation looks much more promising. Next year, we will see new semi-custom design wins come into place as well as the delivery of an all-new architecture that will replace the current one, which has been one of the biggest causes of AMD's decade of turmoil. These products will keep its foundation in tack in the mid-term as the growth of its new sectors continue into the long-term. AMD is a risky stock, but the situation looks plausible and potentially very promising.
Please do your own research before investing and only invest what you can afford to lose entirely, especially with this stock.

2015-03-31,"By now, most people have seen Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) announcement that the PC market will shrink more than expected, with the consequent downward revisions by the industry ""experts."" This portends more problems for AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) in the CPU market, as they will continue to have non-competitive products throughout 2015, and Intel will continue to command a dominant market share. However, AMD's problems not only exist in CPUs, but also in GPUs, where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) embarrased AMD's Radeon line with the introduction of Maxwell, and have continued to expand the line to the point where AMD's sales have collapsed. Unlike the CPU market, where AMD will continue to be dominated and has accepted it, the GPU market is more fluid, and AMD has not submitted to NVIDIA the way it has to Intel.
There has been recent news in this market, that gives some indication as to what we can expect as the year progresses. The aforementioned degeneration of the PC market is one, but other news like FreeSync, Mantle, Titan X, and the R390x will also color the remainder of the year.
Naturally, a card without a PC isn't very useful, so we have to look at the PC market. Strangely, Intel thought the XP demise would continue to buoy the market well into 2015, which it clearly will not. This type of dull thinking is typical of Intel management, as they ignore the obvious - the slowing rate of product improvement does not make people want new machines. Intel's release of disappointing products like Haswell and Broadwell, and AMD's inability to improve performance in their high-end processors since Piledriver is only one part of the problem. The real reason is the market is getting mature, and processors several years old are more than competent enough for the vast majority of people. Clearly, Intel and AMD have been incapable of delivering experiences with their newest CPUs to drive market demand.
This maturity is different for CPUs and GPUs, however. With CPUs, throwing more transistors at the problem only yields relatively small improvements in performance. Essentially, since 2006 when Intel released the Core 2 line, this became part of reality, although certainly more so as time went along. Of course, increased clock speeds are another approach, but even this diminished rapidly in that time period, and seems completely stopped for Intel since leaving the 32nm Sandy Bridge. AMD also hit the highest clock speeds on 32nm, not 28nm, and it's unlikely to change dramatically when the company moves to FinFets in 2016. I say this because Intel designs for higher performance, with less focus on cost, whereas fabs like Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) (which is the same technology GloFo uses) sell primarily lower clocked devices that are more cost sensitive.
GPUs, however, are different. Because of their parallel nature, they scale very well with more transistors, but are still limited by cost and power issues. While new fabrication nodes have not improved performance for several years, they still do lower cost per transistors (albeit to a lesser extent than in the past), and do improve power characteristics. Also, if you look at stale releases like Haswell, Broadwell, Steamroller, and Excavator, then compare it to Maxwell, and to a lesser extent Tonga, you can see that design improvements in GPUs greatly exceed those on CPUs. In fact, design improvements have been the driving force for new releases from AMD and NVIDIA for several years, as both companies have been stuck on the 28nm process.
That's still the case today, but recent advances from fabrication partners will soon change this, although exactly when remains a matter of uncertainty. But, both AMD and NVIDIA have other developments that still attempt to push performance forward.
From the NVIDIA camp, we have the just released Titan X. While we knew quite a bit about this before the release, now that we know the specifics it, it has to be considered a bit disappointing. This does not make it a bad product, because the expectations were based on the very capable GTX 980. However, the card offers roughly 33% improvement in speed, while being approximately 50% larger, and using 50% more power. Also, the 64-bit floating point performance is abysmal, far lower than the previous Titan, although consistent with the GTX 980's poor FP64 performance. Again, this does not make the Titan X a poor card by any stretch, as it's still quite efficient, and easily better than anything AMD has. But, it does show relatively poor scaling compared to the GTX 980, in both size and power use.
Another offering from NVIDIA is G-Sync, which will almost certainly fade into irrelevance. It's not a bad technology, it is just NVIDIA's excessive pricing that will render it irrelevant. Many will argue about this, but this is clearly a big win for AMD, since their solution is an open standard, and requires no royalty to be paid to the company, as opposed to NVIDIA requiring royalties. There are arguments back and forth on which is better from a technical perspective, but the reality is, they are very close, and the differences are relatively minor. It is very unlikely this will determine which standard is adopted. Also, Intel still sells the majority of GPUs, by virtue of their CPU sales, and it is far more likely it will support an open standard without a royalty, than pay NVIDIA. Of course, nothing is ever 100% when one talks about the future, but this is as close as it gets.
Another important win for AMD was with Mantle technology. This forced Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to create DX12, which shows better improvement with AMD GPUs than NVIDIA. This test is more to show the comparison between DX12, and DX11, and is very synthetic by nature, so should be treated with caution. However, one thing is certain, the new APIs improve the relative importance of the GPU compared to the CPU, and also improve performance significantly in many scenarios. This can only help GPU sales.
AMD also had other reasons for pushing Mantle, and forcing the hand of other API developers, as their newest emphasis on asynchronous shading essentially required a change in the API. Mantle has proven to be an enormous success for AMD.
Lastly, we should consider new AMD products. The R390X has been spoken about for quite some time, but still has not been released. Clearly the product exists, since AMD has said it is finalizing it, and has shown it demonstrating Oculus Rift. Based on what is strongly rumored, it will roughly as fast as Titan X, and almost certainly be better for GPGPU workloads, but the efficiency is not known yet. Much of this is based on the lack of information regarding whether it is on TSMC's (NYSE:TSM) 20nm planar node, or GloFo's 28nm node. The former would be less expensive, once yields matured, and use less power, but would require access to 20nm wafers which may be in short supply since both Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are using them. It would also require more development work, which AMD may have chosen to bypass, and develop instead for GloFo's FinFets. Either way, the part will have performance, but the size and performance per watt remain uncertain, and likely behind NVIDIA's if AMD chose the 28nm node. According to this site, the 390x will use 300 watts, and be priced at $700+, although this must be treated as rumor, even if it does seem plausible. If true, it would be far more attractive than the $1000 Titan X, by virtue of price, and considering it will be a superior co-processor than the more targeted NVIDIA offering.
One advantage that NVIDIA has with G-Sync is, virtually all of its cards can support G-Sync, since the logic is primarily on the monitor. Of course, this adds expense, but does not put them in the awkward position AMD is in, where only a subset of the devices support FreeSync. As many people know, both NVIDIA and AMD have indulged in ""re-badging"", where they use an old part, and put a new label on it to make it seem part of the new family. With FreeSync, I believe this is no longer tenable for AMD, as it would cause market confusion, with potential ill-will. A fundamental part of the 3xx line must be support for FreeSync, and this may delay some parts while AMD does the development work. This may be part of the reason for AMD's delay in releasing the R390 parts, as they may feel it will hurt the existing 2xx parts, particularly when one considers Lisa Su's statements about clearing out downstream inventory in Q1.
As I see it, the situation for NVIDIA can only get worse, but that's mainly because their situation is very strong to begin with. Their Maxwell technology is an unqualified success, which has left AMD soundly outclassed in every segment. However, it's a different situation than their relationship with Intel, another company that has outclassed AMD completely. Against Intel, AMD fled like a rat from a bobcat, and tried desperately to find ways of surviving in different markets, rather than continuing to compete head-on in the higher-end PC market. Against NVIDIA, there is no concession of inferiority, but instead open defiance, and unspoken confidence that the current situation can, and will, be reversed. Successes in Mantle and FreeSync are the prelude to the release of the 3xx series of cards, which will no doubt see the market soon. While not as tangible as performance, there also can be no doubt AMD continues to be the brand customers want to succeed, as it gives the impression of being the best for the industry. After all, who offered a royalty free approach to improving stuttering and tearing? AMD. Who pushed the development of GPGPU technologies, and HUMA? AMD. Who pushed Microsoft in offering a higher performing API, benefiting all PC gamers? AMD. NVIDIA? They're the ones that gave faulty information about their video card, demand royalties from monitor companies, and only seem to push technologies that give a direct monetary award. Oh, and price their flagship device at $1000, far more than AMD ever has for a single GPU card, even when it performs best.
Of course, AMD has to offer compelling technology, at least close to what NVIDIA does, with the 300 line. If it does, and I think they will get close based on their confidence, everything else favors the company, including a strong relationship with Apple. This should lead to a strong second half for the company.
Of course, higher-end CPUs will continue to have more importance, but hopefully 2016 will see the emergence of Zen as a competitive product, and end AMD's quiet surrender to Intel in that segment. But, for 2015, the story for AMD is GPUs, and it looks like it will have a happy ending.

2007-03-01,"The microprocessor wars rage on. Gurinder Kalra, an analyst at Bear Stearns, today trimmed his earnings estimates on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and warned that the stock could drop to trough valuation levels of $11-$12 a share.
Kalra says AMD is likely to gain market share in the second half of 2007 and in 2008, but due to aggressive pricing, rather than any technological edge. Meanwhile, Kalra says that first quarter unit shipments are tracking -
well below our conservative expectations… due to weaker than expected demand for AMD in mature markets, the company’s inability to penetrate existing accounts given its less competitive product roadmap, and our belief that some of its desktop customers have increased their activities with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
Kalra expects AMD unit share to drop 140 basis points to 23.7% in the first quarter from the fourth quarter. He predicts that second quarter processor pricing “will deteriorate significantly beyond current market expectations,” and also thinks the company’s market share will fall in the second quarter “given the lack of new product introductions.”
Kalra also expects AMD’s fabs to be under-utilized in the the year’s first two quarters, “further impacting gross margins.”
Kalra cut his first quarter revenue estimate to $1.53 billion from $1.65 billion; he increased the expected loss for the quarter to 22 cents a share, from 11 cents. For 2007, he now sees a loss of 58 cents a share, widening from 15 cents; for 2008 he now sees a profit of 35 cents a share, down from 50 cents.
This morning, AMD is down 25 cents at $14.82. Rival Intel is down 43 cents at $19.43.
AMD vs. INTC 1-yr chart"
2007-03-01,"Eric Ross, chip analyst at ThinkEquity, asserted today that Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) February microprocessor sales were “much stronger than expected,” offsetting a very weak January. Ross says he believes sales were above seasonality, with the company taking back some market share from Advance Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
Ross advises investors to consider buying Intel shares for upside to $23 a share, while selling Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) - which reports earnings today after the close, by the way - as well as AMD.
Ross says that Windows Vista was not really a factor in the better sales. “We have heard across the PC channel that the release of Vista drove a small bubble that did not really last,” he writes. “We do not expect Vista to be a real driver for increased PC sales until [the second half] at the earliest, and likely 2008.”
On the pricing front, Ross says that “after a lull for the holiday season, we believe AMD and Intel are back at each other’s throats.”
He reiterated his Accumulate rating on Intel shares.
Today, Intel is down 25 cents to $19.61; AMD is off 21 cents at $14.86.
Earlier: AMD: Bear Stearns Chops Estimates, Sees Disappointing Demand and Lower Stock Price"
2007-03-06,"Advanced Micro Devices warned yesterday it will likely come up short of its Q1 (ending Mar. 31) revenue target of $1.6 - $1.7 billion. Analysts were expecting $1.66b, according to a Thomson poll. AMD's shares opened 4% lower yesterday, touching their lowest levels since Oct. 2004, but rallied back some to finish down 1.6% to $13.95. The Wall Street Journal notes at yesterday's Morgan Stanley investor conference AMD CEO Hector Ruiz said he is still ""bullish for the company for the year"" and is ""not in any way disappointed that we have to make some adjustments."" Ruiz cited problems related to a change in AMD's distribution strategy in order to meet demand from new large customers. One analyst comments problems at Dell likely hurt AMD, but he doesn't agree with Ruiz that AMD's issues are short-term. Separately, Prudential Financial reiterated its ""underweight"" rating on AMD, while lowering its target share price to $12 from $16.

2007-03-06,"Several firms commenting Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) after the company announced yesterday morning that it is unlikely to meet its revenue guidance:
- Morgan Stanley believes AMD's margins will be under severe pressure as it suffers from aggressive pricing competition in MPUs, as well as a product line that is currently inferior to its primary competitors. While AMD's product portfolio should be more competitive in the second half of this year, firm expects its financials to remain under pressure for at least several quarters. Meaningful losses are likely during the first half of this year, and they could continue into the second half of the year as well. In addition, firm believes that AMD will need to raise capital to fund its previously planned capex investments for 2007. Consequently, they maintain their Underweight-V rating on AMD.
Firm's 2007 and 2008 EPS estimates are now ($0.50) and $0.60 respectively versus $0.15 and $0.84 previously.
- Cowen notes that AMD announced that 1Q07 (March) results would likely fall below rev guidance of $1.6-1.7B, down 4-10% seq. Mgmt attributed the primary source of weakness to inability to provide certain commitments to their distributors which have resulted in share losses presumably to INTC. Mgmt admitted to having ""taken their eye off"" the ball with respect to its distribution partners as AMD ramped into new OEM customers. Mgmt continues to highlight pricing pressure in the server end market as a significant source of weakness. Firm believes it is too early to call a bottom in shares of AMD. In their opinion, the visibility limitations make a valuation call on these growth shares incredibly challenging. Firm expects the data flow regarding fundamentals to remain negative over the near-term. Without any significant positive catalysts on the horizon, they expect shares to remain under pressure.
Firm expect the pricing pressure coupled with the integration of ATI's lower margin consumer-related business units is likely to result in sustained GM pressure. They believe the feasibility of achieving the 50% GM target exiting 2007 appears increasingly unrealistic.
- JMP offering a contrarian view, upgrading the share to Market Outperform from Market Perform, with price tgt of $15 based on 15x their Street-high 2008 EPS estimate of $1.15 (Street @ $0.78 with a wide range). The upgrade is based on:
Firm's proprietary industry and channel research indicates that AMD's next-generation ""Barcelona"" quad-core server chip and next-generation low-power mobile PC processor chip is exhibiting excellent power, performance, scalability, and price/performance characteristics at key OEM customers such as HPQ, Dell, IBM, Fujitsu-Siemens, Sun, and Lenovo. Firm believes that the next-generation quad-core Opteron server chip and the next-generation low-power mobile processor chip will level the playing field with Intel. The new products may allow AMD to regain the performance mantle in the high-margin server chip market with performance gains of 20-30% over equivalent Intel Xeon server chip while also allowing AMD to target the high-margin corporate and small-business notebook PC market with bundled low-power processor/integrated graphics solutions.
While the ATYT merger has been a rocky one with delays and market share losses in several discrete and integrated graphics segments, firm's research suggests that the new AMD Series 690 integrated graphics chipset for desktops and notebooks, with full support for Vista DX10 graphics, HD video, and Blu-Ray/HD DVD, will likely allow AMD to achieve renewed success in the consumer and corporate PC market. Also, despite a 30-45 day delay in the production availability of AMD's next-generation high-end R600 discrete graphics chip competing with NVDA's GeForce8800, firm's research indicates that AMD has successfully addressed the production and power bottlenecks with the R600, and the solution will likely be successfully bundled with AMD's high-end Athlon64 processors for OEM and channel customers.
Firm's research also suggest that AMD's manufacturing yields on 65nm technology on 12-inch wafer production are ramping well, about one quarter ahead of schedule, and will likely allow AMD processor margins with the better product mix to quickly rebound to the 50-52% level from current levels of 40% over the next 12 to 18 months. Given the increased production volumes, AMD will likely be able to satisfy its rapidly expanding OEM and channel customers with plentiful supplies of high-end dual-core processors beyond the current quarter.
Notablecalls: While most of the Street is negative (to say it mildly), I actually like JMP's opinion. Too bad they are probably 1-2 quarters too early with the upgrade. However, if they are right about Barcelona, AMD shareholders do have better times ahead.
AMD 1-yr chart:"
2007-03-06,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) announced yesterday that it was unlikely to meet its previously estimated revenue guidance:
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Hector Ruiz will present at the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference today at 10:30 a.m. PT (1:30 p.m. ET) and will update the company’s first quarter 2007 guidance. Ruiz will discuss that AMD is unlikely to meet its previously estimated revenue guidance of $1.6 to $1.7 billion for the first quarter of 2007 as well as provide a product and technology outlook. A real-time audio webcast of the presentation will be available here.
Note that Ruiz will provide a “product and technology outlook,” as opposed to any additional financial outlook. Given that many semiconductor companies tend to get a large portion of their sales in the final month of a quarter, it is often possible to meet targets by offering discounts to customers near the end of the quarter. If the company is too aggressive in doing so, they “stuff the channel” with inventory and miss out on the opportunity to sell it in a later quarter. We believe that has been happening in the microprocessor segment. For example, on Hewlett Packard’s recent conference call, Chief Financial Officer Catherine Lesjak said:
While we appropriately make inventory trade-offs, including some strategic buys to take advantage of deals and thereby reduce our overall bill of material costs, we need to do a better job in inventory management, and you should expect us to work on reducing inventory levels going forward.
It was one thing to stock up inventory just in case Windows Vista turned out to be a big hit. Now the impact is known, and it is softer than expected. So now HP will “work on reducing inventory levels.”
That means no end-of-quarter pickup for AMD, who appears to be throwing in the towel on this quarter. The revenue will not meet the guidance of $1.6 - $1.7 billion, which we assume to mean will be less than $1.6. Consensus was at $1.66. Rather than discount further with no hope of “meeting the numbers,” AMD may be more firm about its own pricing decisions and let the market work through this on its own. Unfortunately, we believe it will take more than one quarter for that to happen. It will take even longer if they continue to build more inventory than the market can absorb.
AMD 1-yr chart:"
2007-03-09,"Chris Caso, an analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey, yesterday asserted that the problems Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is having in the first quarter are more tied to loss of market share to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) than to any software in the overall PC market.
Caso also thinks the company is suffering from a glut of low-end processors in the supply chain. “We believe the magnitude is more than a one-quarter issue,” he says. “Our checks also suggest the inventory consists of older [processors] that have been difficult to move despite two price cuts this quarter. Net, we think AMD faces a problem similar to Intel’s problem last year, with excess low-priced product that customers do not want to buy.”
Caso also contends that AMD is going to run into a cash crunch: he sees the company burning $1.2 billion of its $1.5 billion in cash this year. He thinks annual EPS could be diluted by 5-10 cents a share by a capital raise.
For 2007, Caso trimmed his revenue forecast to $6.67 billion from $7.3 billion; he now sees a loss of 39 cents a share, versus a loss of 7 cents previously. For the first quarter, his revenue estimate drops to $1.524 billion from $1.65 billion; EPS estimate goes to a loss of 23 cents a share from a loss of 12 cents. Caso says he sees downside in the stock to $10, based on the company’s historic valuation.
AMD yesterday was down 8 cents at $14.02."
2007-03-09,"Merrill Lynch notes that the central issue for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is always gross margin, and the firm recently spent some time with management trying to understand the company's plans. They think that Intel is a lot more interested in reducing AMD to its former status than in showing much gross margin improvement this year. Investors looking for Intel to deliver GM upside are likely to be disappointed.
Intel has bigger plans for 2008, and management clearly hopes to be able to show more meaningful GM improvement. Here's the problem - Intel's plans aren't going to work out unless AMD backs off. AMD may be in a difficult situation now, but it still has a decent product portfolio for this year and enough money to fund its capital spending plans.
The firm does credit Intel with taking a much harder line on operating expenses, and that should allow the company to deliver on their $1.10 estimate this year even as the battle with AMD continues. Intel has historically had difficulty controlling opex during periods of revenue growth, but they think that's changing.
Making money on the stock is going to be tough in the absence of sustainable gross margin improvement, though. The microprocessor business is becoming a duopoly, albeit a lopsided one. Intel's stockholders will be better off when the company's management realizes that and acts accordingly. Maintains Neutral.
Notablecalls: Interesting comments by MLCO's Joe Osha. However given the recent slide in INTC's stock I don't think there will be much of an impact."
2007-03-21,"Eric Gomberg, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners, yesterday trimmed his estimates on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), citing expectations of further price cuts. He also expects the company to raise additional capital in the public market in the next several months. Gomberg asserts that he is “incrementally more negative on shares given pricing, channel and financial challenges.”
Gomberg writes in a research note that he expects a round of price cuts averaging 30%-35% on April 9 on its “problematic inventory.” He notes the cuts will be just 3 weeks after the last round of price cuts, on March 16. “While the price cuts may stimulate some demand, we believe the product mix and stale inventory ultimately remain major headwinds likely to persist through [the second quarter] and possibly later,” he writes.
As for possible financings, Gomberg says he expects a $1 billion convertible deal in the second quarter. “We believe ongoing concerns regarding potential financing is likely to continue to weight on shares, although we believe that management may have other options (including the possibility of lowering its capex requirements,” he writes.
For 2007, Gomberg now looks for a loss of 46 cents a share; he had expected a loss of 28 cents. For 2008, he sees a profit of 22 cents, which is down from 46 cents. His rating on the stock remains Market Weight.

My colleague Steve Sears, who writes about options for Barron’s and Barrons.com, passes along the word that AMD options are trading higher on rumors that the company could receive a cash infusion from a private equity investor or strategic partner. The theory, apparently, is that the chipmaker could do a deal similar to the $700 million investment Sun Microsystems (NASDAQ:SUNW) received recently from KKR.
In a post earlier today, I noted that Thomas Weisel analyst Eric Gomberg expects the company to raise capital in the next few months; he is anticipating a convertible deal in the neighborhood of $1 billion.
AMD is up 56 cents at $13.97."
2007-03-27,"TWP notes today's CPU environment is a difficult one, particularly with the aggressive ongoing price cuts between Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). The firm is incrementally more positive on Intel, however, given their findings regarding its long-term server road map, and particularly the Thurley platform. They believe that the dramatic change in architecture (i.e., integrated memory controller and CSI) bodes well for the company as it transitions off of the Bensley platform in 2H08.
Intel will introduce its next-generation server platform named Thurley in 2H08 and will feature the Gainestown processor and Tylersburg chipset. Most of the time, a platform upgrade represents an evolutionary step forward-however, they view the introduction of Thurley as a revolutionary change and dramatic improvement in Intel's core system architecture.
Gainestown-Intel's masterpiece in the works: Similar to Barcelona, Gainestown will be a monolithic quad-core processor in the Nehalem family and will be manufactured at a mature 45nm node. The most dramatic architectural changes, however, lie in the use of Common System Interface [CSI] and an integrated DDR3 memory controller (iMC). CSI is a coherent, point-to-point interconnect (similar to AMD's coherent HyperTransport), and replaces the aging Front-Side Bus (NYSE:FSB). Gainestown will also feature a shared 8MB cache, improved power efficiency and Hyper-Threading capabilities. Firm's checks on Gainestown have come back extremely favorably, with OEMs and systems builders particularly excited about the adoption of the DDR3 iMC and CSI.
The firm is incrementally more positive on shares of Intel given the shift in market momentum toward Core 2 products (i.e., Woodcrest, Clovertown, Conroe and Merom), and are further encouraged by Intel's longer-term road map, particularly on server. Given the current aggressive pricing environment, however, they believe that pricing will weigh on margins in the near term. Despite trading below the historical average P/E of 23x, they believe that shares are fairly valued, trading at 15x 2008 EPS estimates of $1.25. Maintains Market Weight rating on shares.
Notablecalls: Not actionable but good to know category. Goes to show how little head start AMD has with their Barcelona.

2007-03-28,"(NASDAQ: REGN ) was up 15% on news that its drug for age-related macular degeneration, partnered with(BAY), produced positive interim data in a Phase II trial.
The drug is VEGF Trap-Eye that is being given to patients with neovascular or wet AMD. In the first half of the patients who will be enrolled, the drug reduced retinal thickness after 12 weeks and increased the ability of patients to read an eye chart by a mean of 5.9 letters. Regeneron rose $2.85 to $22.00.
Also higher was CV Therapeutics (CVTX). On March 7, CV Therapeutics took a 24% hit after it announced that Ranexa did not meet its endpoints in a Phase III trial. The company was attempting to prove that Ranexa would decrease the overall incidence of heart attacks, death and recurrent ischemia in patients with heart disease.
Yesterday, in an expanded discussion of the trial results, officials from CV Therapeutics showed that Ranexa was effective against ischemia, where the heart muscles do not receive enough oxygen because of blocked blood flow, even though it did not meet its primary endpoint. Ranexa was approved in January 2006 to treat angina. CV Therapeutics climbed $1.21 to $7.96.
BioCryst (NASDAQ:BCRX) fell after the company put a hold on a Phase IIb trial using the IV formulation of Fodosine in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL). The material was found to contain particulate matter. Trials of an oral form of the drug (a tablet) were not affected. BioCryst proffered the explanation that the material seemed to come from the stoppers of the vials that hold the drug, perhaps caused by a reaction between Fodosine and the material in the stopper.
The company also said that the response rate in the Phase IIa trial of IV Fodosine in this population was lower than originally reported, which was 18%. Final data are not in, but the company expects they will be below 18%. BioCryst fell $1.58 to end at $8.00.
CombinatoRX (CRXX) reported that CRx-139 failed a Phase II test for rheumatoid arthritis. However, the drug did achieve statistical significance on some of the secondary endpoints. CombinatoRX slipped 24 cents lower to $7.02.
The FDA commented on Provenge from Dendreon (NASDAQ:DNDN), the vaccine for prostate cancer, ahead of an advisory panel meeting that will discuss the drug on Thursday. As expected, the staff report stated that Provenge increased median survival, but missed other measures of effectiveness. Dendreon edged up 8 cents to $4.62.
AtheroGenics (AGIX) commented more fully on the failure of AGI-1067 to meet its Phase III trial endpoint, which was timed to first incidence of a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events. The company stressed that, on the positive side, the drug met several “hard” secondary endpoints, all of which were predefined. These included cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke, as well as improvement in the key diabetes parameters of new onset diabetes and glycemic control. AtheroGenics dropped 28 cents to $3.30.
Seattle Genetics (NASDAQ:SGEN) received $4.5 million from Genetech (Private:DNA) to extend their partnership, under which Genentech has rights to certain targets and two companies collaborate to develop antibody-drug conjugates. Seattle Genetics moved up 9 cents to $8.15.
Adams Respiratory (ARXT) signed a deal with MonoSolRx LLC to use the latter company’s thin film technology to develop rapid dissolve oral prescription and OTC drugs. Although specific terms were not disclosed, MonoSolRx will receive milestone payments and a royalty on any marketed products. Adams has the right to develop two or more respiratory products in North America. An initial target has been defined, though the information was not released. Adams was off by 7 cents at $34.02.
Isis Pharma (ISIS) summarized data from three Phase II trials presented this week on ISIS 301012, an anti-cholesterol drug. Without any deleterious effect on HDL (good) cholesterol, a 400 mg dose of ISIS 301012 caused 100% of patients to achieve their LDL cholesterol and triglyceride targets. There was no sign of liver side effects, and the drug was effective as a single agent and when added to treatment with statins. Isis traded 24 cents lower to $9.62.
CuraGen (CRGN) and TopoTarget A/S began treating patients in a Phase II trial of belinostat, a small molecule histone deacetylase [HDAC] inhibitor. The drug will be given as an adjunct to Velcade (a Millenium (MLNM) drug) in patients with multiple myeloma as a second-line treatment. CuraGen edged up a penny to $3.86.
Myriad Genetics (NASDAQ:MYGN) initiated a Phase II trial of Azixa in patients with melanoma that has spread to the brain. The trial has three arms: Azixa, temozolomide and a combination of Azixa plus temozolomide. Myriad dropped 48 cents to end at $34.58.
Barrier Therapeutics (OTC:BTRX) reported positive data from a Phase IIb trial of its oral antifungal pramiconazole (previously known as Azoline).

2007-03-30,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shares continue their steady slide earthward, yesterday morning setting a new 52-week low - and in fact, dropping to their lowest level since September 2004. The latest issue for the troubled microprocessor company: an enthusiastic Street response to Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) microprocessor road map, which it laid out for analysts on a conference call Wednesday.
The call focused on two upcoming processor families. First, there’s Penryn, which is supposed to launch in the second half of this year; that will be followed by Nehalem, which follows in 2008.
Sumit Dhanda, an analyst with Bank of America, asserted in a research note yesterday that Penryn will provide 20%-45% better performance than existing processors, blunting the upside from AMD’s pending launch of its Barcelona processors. The new processors will also be manufactured on a small silicon die - it will be 25% smaller than the Meron and Conroe chip families - which means a cost advantage for Intel.
John Lau, an analyst at Jefferies & Co., likewise says that Penryn gives Intel “a tremendous competitive boost” in terms of performance.
Dhanda says the Nehalem processors will be a “game changer,” noting that it will include an integrated memory controller - a feature AMD already offers with its Opteron processor. The company will also integrate a graphics core on the chip.
Doug Freedman, an analyst at American Technology Research, says Intel’s comments confirmed his view that the company will maintain its edge over AMD beyond the Barcelona launch later this year. “It is becoming obvious that AMD’s only weapon, outside of Barcelona this year, is price,” he wrote. “Intel is moving to smaller die sizes as it moves down the process scale and will maintain a cost and performance advantage. With AMD’s products getting stale in the channel, we believe Intel is firmly positioned to recapture share in the server space and the high end while conceding lower margin portions of the market to AMD.”
Intel shares yesterday were down 9 cents at $18.77; AMD was down 35 cents at $13.03."
2014-05-31,"Today's tech industry is one of the most fast paced, dynamic, high growth and high risk industries in the world. Companies come to dominate their sector within years and old behemoths can fall fast (just look at the rise of Facebook and the fall of MySpace). Of course this reality is not limited to internet websites or apps; even hardware manufacturers can fall victim to the cruelty of this industry. A prime example is BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY), once the dominate force in smartphones and business is today barely hanging on to life, losing billions of dollars each quarter and struggling to maintain its small market share. The lesson of BlackBerry is that its leadership failed to accept and adapt to the new reality - touch screens were here to stay. Tech Companies must always be mindful of change and seek out innovative opportunities for growth. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is similar in some ways to BlackBerry, in the last few years, profits have turned into losses, revenue has declined and it has been struggling against powerful rivals. Unlike Blackberry, however, their management has recognized the problems in time and begun to move the company in a profitable direction. Despite this the stock price has been falling and the market has shown an opportunity for the intelligent investor to buy AMD at a bargain.
AMD Undervalued
The current price for a share is $4.00, which comes to a total market capitalization of just $3.05 billion. Yet, AMD is a company with assets of $4.1 billion, including $2.7 billion of current assets and $0.9 billion of cash and marketable securities. Furthermore, AMD's enterprise value is $4.3 billion (41% higher than their market cap) and has working capital of $1.3 billion (43% of the market cap value). All these point to an enterprise that is undervalued in the market; the question now is whether or not AMD can return to stable profits and regain their lost market capitalization.
Q1 2014 Results
AMD earned a profit of $12 million or $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2014 on sales of $1.4 billion and operating income of $66 million. This was the company's third profitable quarter in a row and represents an increase in revenues of 28% from Q1 2013. These are reassuring results but also consider:
The last four quarters have seen total net profit of $43 million
Second Quarter revenues are estimated (by management) to increase by 3% from Q1 2014 which is a 24% growth from Q2 2013
Management is focused on improving profitability by focusing on growth segments and reducing operating expenses by 30% since the start of 2012
These strong results from a typically weak first quarter along with expected sales growth are encouraging, but there are far more important things to consider when analyzing AMD.
Strategy
I mentioned earlier that it's critically important for tech companies to constantly innovate and be mindful of changes within the tech industry. In the past AMD's focus has been on their 'PC solutions' business, but in the last couple of years management has switched their focus to 'Graphics and Visual Solutions'. This is a smart plan because they are turning focus away from the sector where Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is the dominant player and shifting into a sector where they themselves are a top player. Additionally, management has decided to steer away from the ""high volume, low margin"" business of smartphone processors and instead focus on tablets, two in ones, laptops, and dedicated gaming consoles. This is a critically important strategy because it will allow AMD to increase both sales and profitability while avoiding their biggest competitor Intel as much as possible. The results of this strategy are shown in the chart below:
Revenue (in millions) 2012 2013 Computing Solutions $4,005 $3,104 Graphic & Visual Sol. $1,417 $2,193 Other - $2 Total $5,422 $5,299
Sales of their Graphics solutions have increased 55% from 2012 while sales of their PC solutions have decreased 22% (largely due to stiff competition from Intel). It's not only the sales that are the issue, operating profits from their PC solutions segment have been negative the last two years (a loss of $231 million in 2012 and $22 million in 2013), while their Graphics solutions segment has had growing operating profits the last three years ($51 million in 2011, $103 million in 2012, $216 million in 2013). This trend has continued into the first quarter of 2014 with operating profits of $91 million for their graphic solutions business while they still ran a slight loss of $3 million on their PC solutions business. The management of AMD has promised to continue this strategy into 2016 and remain focused on generating profits each quarter and to pay down long-term debt. I believe this is a winning strategy that will return the company to profitability this fiscal year and increase their stability as well as their growth potential.
Stock Performance
The graph below shows AMD's stock price going back to when they were last profitable - in 2011. Back then the company's PC solutions segment was doing great and their stock price topped $8.50 per share.
AMD data by YCharts
Since then, the price has fallen as the company's sales decreased and their profits disappeared. The fall was justified. But, the current price is not reflecting the progress AMD has made the last four quarters and is certainly not showing the future value and potential this company has. Other things to consider:
AMD has the lowest Price to Sales ratio in the industry at just 0.55 compared to an industry average of 17.79 and Intel's 2.54
Trailing P/E ratio is a misleading 83.3 due to low profits, forward P/E ratio is a much more reasonable 17.3
The stock price increased to above $8 per share when it released results showing a profitable 2011, another strong increase could be expected when profitable fiscal 2014 results are released
Conclusion
With AMD's new strategy already showing signs of turning the company back into a profit machine and with the great potential of growth from their new graphics focused approach, AMD can look to deliver and exceed investors' expectations. Furthermore, as sales and profits improve, AMD's stock price will increase to reflect the true value of this company. I rate as a strong buy at $4 per share.

2014-06-19,"Manufacturers can save money by making AMD-powered gamer-centric laptops without the need for discrete GPU cards. Gamers are the ultimate winners because of cheaper price tags.
As long as Intel is not focusing on gamers, AMD can attract big-name ODM and OEM firms with affordable APUs for gaming laptops.
AMD brings the legendary FX brand name to laptop gamers. The new quad-core FX-7600P comes with 8-cores of Radeon R7 graphics power.
This is another great development for gamers. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) announced its new Kaveri-powered mobile FX APUs at Computex 2014. AMD's old CPU-only FX processors for desktop computers were legendary for their octacore power. Thanks to its eight cores of Radeon R7 GPU, The 35W TDP FX-7600P will give ultrabooks desktop-quality gaming performance.
Source: AMD
The more energy efficient 19W TDP AMD FX-7500, which only comes with six cores of R7 graphics, will deliver more than 50% better gaming performance than an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i7 Haswell CPU. AMD cannot compete with cash-rich Intel in tablets this year, but it can seriously compete in the gaming laptop category.
Kaveri To The Rescue
The Kaveri mobile APU is an energy-efficient product, which boasts support for Mantle, Graphics Core Next (GCN), and Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA). The new FX and AMD A-Series Pro aims to bring desktop-level gaming performance to laptops starting at $400 retail price level.

AMD's graphics market share has been losing ground to Intel and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for the last two quarters. An aggressive push towards gaming notebooks may help AMD's overall GPU business. Cheaper but more powerful gaming laptops will entice more gamers to buy AMD-equipped notebooks.

AMD's x86 PC business continues to decline but the company is aggressively developing cheaper APUs that should attract more industry support. The PC gaming community is a huge $25 billion market that AMD can continue to rely on. Kaveri promises to deliver console-like gaming power to Windows laptops.
MMORPG and MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) gamers will need gaming laptops to continue practicing their Dota 2 or League of Legends skills. MOBA gamers in North America and European Union countries are gravely addicted. Based on the chart below, MOBA gamers are spending more than 1.7 billion playing hours every month.

The more people that gets addicted to MOBA games, the better it is for AMD investors. The total addressable market for mobile Kaveri-equipped notebooks benefits from continuous growth in PC gamers' population.
Industry Support
Rory Read's former employer and world's number one PC vendor, Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), will be the first company to bring out notebooks with mobile Kaveri/FX APUs. AMD Kaveri will be inside the 15.6-inch Flex 2, 14-inch Flex 2, and $399 B50 and G50 laptops. Lenovo will also be using AMD APUs in its high-end Z-Series laptops, which starts at $579.
This is another good turn of events. AMD is no longer discriminated against among x86-based PC makers. The new mobile APUs will not be relegated to sub-$350 notebooks. Intel's current focus on mobile chips for tablets this year will distract it enough to let AMD slowly penetrate the high-margin premium laptop sector.
I expect Acer, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) to also come up with Kaveri-powered laptops before 2014 ends. Take note that these AMD gaming laptops will also be capable of running most Android apps inside the Windows 8.1 OS. AMD has contracted BlueStacks to create an AMD-exclusive special version of their Android Emulator software.
Conclusion
A $400 Kaveri-equipped gaming laptop is very attractive to millions of gamers. AMD investors will appreciate it very much if Rory Read can revive the company's falling market share in GPUs. Gamers accustomed to the FX brand name for their old desktop gaming rigs should also be impressed with the new FX-7600P and FX-7600 quad-core APUs.
A return to more than 20% market share in graphics sales is highly desirable. AMD has been trading sideways around the $4.00 price level. I hope Lenovo's global distribution network and the low price tags of Kaveri-powered gaming notebooks helps AMD breach the $5 barrier this year.
Kaveri needs to pay-off big time to make AMD's big gamble on ATI purchase a winning preposition. This company's stock used to trade above $42 in 2006. The huge debt that AMD had to incur was due to the overpricing of the ATI acquisition. On the other hand, ATI's fusion technology of CPU/GPU has allowed AMD to outpace Intel in terms of making game-centric x86 SoCs.
Source: Finviz
The current low 0.54 Price/Sales ratio of AMD makes it a good long-term Buy. Despite the heavy debt (4.18 Debt/Equity) handicap of AMD, five analysts from BarChart still rate it as a Buy. Five other analysts polled by FT.com support the Buy rating of those five analysts from BarChart.
I heed the assessments of those ten analysts. I remain long on AMD.

Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
Welcome everyone to this session with AMD. I'm Vivek Arya, Semiconductor Analyst at Bank Of America Merrill Lynch. An absolute pleasure to have Devinder Kumar, CFO of AMD join us this morning along with Ruth Cotter and Liz Luckow from the Investor Relations team. What we’ll do is Devinder has some prepared material. He will start with that than just jump into Q&A.
Devinder Kumar
Thank you Vivek. Good morning to everybody. I am here to discuss AMD’s transformation and really we have gone from a Company that was dependent 95% on the PC market and really transformed ourselves or transforming ourselves with significant progress made in 2013. I’ll share with you what we have achieved recently and also how we’re doing it and where we are headed from a view point of diversification in 2015 and 2016.
So I’ll show the obligatory, if this thing works. This is really forward looking statements and based on the environment as we currently see it, and just by way of introduction; I have been with AMD almost 30 years, actually celebrate my 30th anniversary in the July timeframe. So worked in the company here as well as in Asia for 10 years, CFO since January 2013, but really took on the role on an interim basis on October 2012, which is exactly when we launched the reset and restructure of the Company to get into what we call the transformation of AMD over a multi-year period and really it’s about three years to the transformation as we get in 2016.
We are today and especially with the impact that we did from a revenue standpoint of the game console ramp in the second half of 2013, a very different company. If you look to the left, we are evolving in the core markets. The core markets are still important. We need to maintain obviously the traditional PC strongholds, focus on desktop and graphics and in 2013, in the second half we targeted wins in the commercial space in particular with the top three folks that play in the PC space to try to increase revenue and I’ll talk about that in a minute; and then in the notebook space to ahead and increase the product mix or enrich the product mix.
And then more importantly and more exciting actually is our attack in the growth markets. The growth opportunities ahead of us are all real. We have either not focused on that or not really had the products to focus on that and across the board we made progress in 2013 and hope to make even more significant progress in 2014 and beyond and I can tell you that from my standpoint from where we said, we are headed to becoming very different company if you wake up two years from now in the 2016 timeframe and look at AMD as a company.
In October 2012 as I said earlier, we launched the reset and restructure phase. The PC market had shifted dramatically in the middle part of 2012, surprised everybody, surprised the PC customers, the suppliers the foundries including us and we had to go into a massive mode of containing the cost, managing the balance sheet, managing the cash. We had a big debt burden on the company and the debt coming due in 2015, we had speed to go ahead and execute to make sure that debt power that was with us just about nine months ago to the tune of $580 million could be addressed, and we’ve successfully done that.
In the 2013 timeframe, really a tale of two halves. We had the first half that was still challenging and difficult as we went ahead and took the actions on headcount and space, bringing down the OpEx from a high of almost $600 million in Q1 2012 to our target which we communicated a year ahead that we are going to find a way to get to $450 million in Q3 of 2013 and we successfully did that, but more importantly, we had to make sure that we continue to invest in products and technology so that when we got to 2014 and ‘15, we had the products to go ahead and participate in the market.
We have completed the first two phases essentially in the reset restructure and then the first half of 2013 and really in the second half of 2013 laid the foundation for what we are doing in 2014. Make no mistake about it, we’re still in transformation mode, we still have a lot of work to do in 2014 and getting to 2015 and our next target, which we’ll be very public about is by the time we get to -- by the end of 2015 we want 50% of our revenue to be coming from the non-PC and in particular the growth opportunities that we have identified and I’ll talk about that a little bit more as we get in the presentation.
We have set the path to success metric driven and we want to go ahead and do that as we have done in the past. We laid out a bunch of things that we said we would do a year ahead or six months ahead or even 18 months ahead and the one thing that has been key to our recent success has been the management team under our CEO that just joined the company less than three years ago, with laser focus on delivering our commitments to our customers in the product space and in particular for me, near and dear to my heart on the financial piece of it.
I just got an ear full from someone, I won’t mention who it is on our debt burden that we took on when we acquired ATI and did an 80% cash deal and we are still actually paying off that debt but you have seen us do a couple of transactions over the last few months and last few quarters and that is really going to set us up very nicely for what we need to achieve over the next couple of years. We managed the cash, we have reduced the operating expenses and returned as we said even a year ahead that we would get to non-GAAP profitability and free cash flow by the second half of 2013, which we did.
The ramp in the semi-custom APUs is probably from my standpoint and having been in the Company a lot, for 30 years, almost 30 years, has been probably the best thing that AMD has done from ramping a product standpoint. Sony and Microsoft have announced that they have sold 12 million units since the launch of the product which just happened in November of 2013 and we produced every one of those APUs and had to, to exacting customers with one of the most complicated consumer devices, which is the APUs that are within the game console product for Sony and Microsoft,. They live with that to almost near-perfection.
We have had four consecutive quarters of growth in the embedded space which is an area, I categorize that we always had the products, it was a matter of focus and investing in that business and we had very good success in that area in 2013.
And finally Apple selected AMD’s FirePro for the Mac Pro and that doesn’t happened by accident. Apple, all of us know is a very detailed company in terms of the products they want to buy and put into their particular devices. And then Verizon signed up with us with the SeaMicro Fabric to go ahead and use our product in seven out of their 50 plus datacenters around the world and that is something that we committed to and delivered.
Then if you look at it from a financial standpoint, when I look at it from financial focus standpoint, a disciplined execution is what we want to. We have a plan. We continue to be opportunistic, especially as the markets are concerned. 2014 has started off well. We have a ways to go but just in the last nine months, we have done a couple of transactions; if you look at it from a viewpoint of liquidity and managing the debt.
In November of 2013, we put in place a facility to the tune of $500 million on a secured revolver using our AR facility and now that’s available to us and we have hardly tapped into that. And then earlier this year in the February timeframe, we went ahead and extinguished or virtually extinguished all but $42 million of the $580 million that was due in May of 2015. And then just yesterday, you saw us do another transaction, 10 year money with a call feature, 7% interest rate which is something from a viewpoint of combination of features the best that AMD has done in more than 25, 30 years. We have never had that kind of a deal and I think obviously the momentum that we have, the markets have cooperated.
And if you pull off the second part of it, of extinguishing the 2017 debt tower to the tune of $452 million, I could stand here and say to you that for five years we are virtually debt free and that allows us to go pursue the very transformation in about as aggressive a manner that we could. We couldn’t have said that nine months ago. And then from a viewpoint of executing the new operating model, the one thing that we have done internally is we tell our business units that they have to stand alone on each of the business units on their own, they have to be profitable on an operating income basis. And therefore the decision that you see from an OpEx standpoint, from a profitability standpoint, from the all-important gross margin and operating margin, are made by the general managers under our Head of the Business Units, Dr. Lisa Su which I am sure some of you have met.
And finally on the far right the most important is in all cases we want to go ahead and invest in areas where we differentiate ourselves. We want to grow beyond PCs. We want to diversify as a Company, so that we are not denominated by the one or two competitors that we have always been denominated with. And at the end of 2015, with that goal well on target, we should be able to do that.
From my standpoint, if I look at it from a finance and CFO standpoint, I started this in the late part of 2013 that I said 2014 from a financial focus standpoint we must manage for profitability. We must manage for profitability, grow the business, no matter what happens with the markets and in particular the competitive nature. We must make sure that we are profitable as a Company for 2014 and we have laid out some very specific goals that you've probably seen that not only do we want to grow revenue in 2014 despite the shrinking PC market; we want to be profitable, we want to generate cash and be cash flow positive while in all cases maintaining the cash balance at about a $1 billion which is the optimum balance, optimal cash balance.
The OpEx, we painted a target; $420 million was a guidance in 1Q. We came in a $1 million higher than that at $421 million and we are going to manage between $420 million and $450 million, depending on the ebbs and flows of the revenue and some of the product introduction that we are doing.
As you go to the IP subway [ph], a lot of people asked the question how is it that AMD is able to take down OpEx from $600 million down to below $450 million to $420 million and yet leverage the IP. And the one thing that we have done with Mark Papermaster coming to the Company 2.5 years ago, he is re-using the IP across the board in as many products as we can as opposed to customizing the IP for each customer, each product has to be go forward
And then I know for lot of folks the positive free cash flow is important. The note I would make on that is we did pay $200 million to Global Foundries as part of a prior agreement earlier this year and we want to be cash flow positive, having accounted for the $200 million, which we’re generating more than $200 million positive free cash flow in 2014.
So then if you get to the -- past to 2016 and this is kind of how we do it, to transform the Company. How we’re going to go about making sure that we get to the target of 50% of the revenue coming from the growth opportunities, everyone of this opportunity is real. As I said earlier in each of these areas, if I go back and look at 2013 professional graphics, semi-custom, dense server, embedded in all of those areas very good progress in 2013.
And the momentum continues in the early part of 2014. Good progress. If I look at professional graphics, we had a record year in 2013 in terms of professional graphic space. It’s an area of focus. We’ve hired a lot of people to focus in this area. We have about 20% market share right now. It is highly margin accretive from an AMD standpoint and we want to go ahead and grow that business with the $1.3 billion term that we have.
Semi-custom, you read about it all over the news. You read about it in the press. Sony and Microsoft, the product ramps are higher than every -- any prior generation game console and that benefits us, because every single one of the game console that's sold today by Sony and Microsoft and also Nintendo's Wii U uses AMD technology. 100% of those products use AMD’s technology or AMD’s APU, which benefits us because that’s about a sure, as soon revenue gets from our view point of being an exclusive supplier to probably one of the most complicated consumer devices that's sold on the planet.
And then we have a strong pipeline because of what we did with Sony and Microsoft. The customer interest is very high, across the board, whether you’d look at enterprise in the datacenter or you look at mobility or you look at consumer in the living room and actually other opportunities in a gaming space, we are very confident and we announce one to two opportunities later on this year and continue that momentum because the customer interest and the pipeline is very strong.
In the dense server space, this is an area where we are differentiating ourselves and focusing especially with the ARM license that we have signed because we think that the ARM is going to confer 25% of the server market in 2019. Backend loaded, longer investment cycle, need to engage with our customers with the experience that we have in the server space and finally being able to produce x86 and ARM products in this space, which only one company in the world can do and that’s AMD.
And then in the embedded space it’s a $9 billion term. That includes x86 and ARM. Today we don’t participate in the ARM side of the equation and we will have products using the ARM technology in that space later on this year and that will allow us to get in the networking space with a new set of customers, which is going to pretty exciting, whereby we use AMD’s APU and GPU technology to go ahead and differentiate ourselves.
And then in the ultra-low power client, it’s a big market, $25 billion. I think it’s still settling down, whether it’s tablets, PC’s what people want to do. I think the consumers are still making up their minds, across the board whether it’s Kaveri or Beema and Mullins and Mullins actually with a low form factor is very competitive form a view point of equivalent ARM products or other x86 products out there. And we think we bring a strong value proposition for our customers in that space.
So in summary before we get to the fireside chat, I think you're going to look at -- the Company AMD is involving in a big way, no longer just an x86 company, no longer just a Company that’s dependent on the PC space. Diversification is the key. We get to our target of having 50% of revenue from these growth possibilities by the time we get to 2015. That will be a good thing. And then from my standpoint and from the management team standpoint, in all cases, disciplined execution, delivering on the commitments, whether it’s customers, technology, product roadmap and even in the supply chain. And finally as I said for me, it is continuing to improve the financials, continuing to improve the balance sheet and continuing to improve financial metrics as we go into the 2015, 2016 timeframe. So thank you.
Question-And-Answer Session
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you, Devinder. Thanks a lot for that.
Devinder Kumar
Good to see you again Vivek (ph).
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
Yes, likewise. So I think that, I think you guys have done an outstanding job of stemming the losses, facing the challenges and essentially stabilizing the company. And it’s quite a sea change in the terms of questions that we get now from investors versus a year or two years ago, right. Before it was all about, okay, what’s the next shooter drop -- by how does -- how is the company stabilizing, how is it starting the path to growth. But after giving that complement, let me ask you a question about the PC market, right. That’s still one of your largest end markets. When I look at where the market seems to be stabilizing or perhaps growing, it seems to be an enterprise. It seems to be in things like Chromebooks. It seems to be in sort of these low end tablets. I'm including that in the PC market. But those are not places where AMD has been traditionally. So how are you picking and choosing which area of the PC market you need to be and to stay relevant, so at least it’s not a headwind, a big headwind to you?
Devinder Kumar
Yes, I think what you have to look to at is from a viewpoint of what's changed with AMD. When you have a revenue base in particular in 2013 second half that is coming from the non-PC side and you know that that revenue is going to be there in terms of profitability or generating the revenue dollars or the gross margin dollars or even the cash, then you can start making many different decisions in a space when you’re 95% dependent on it. So that’s really the starting point.
Once you do that, then you say okay, in this particular space I'm going to be very selective to use your words. Our enterprise, commercial -- I think the mic went -- enterprise commercial and even you mentioned with the low form factor, we’ve been under represented. So it was a matter of getting the products into the market. For example in the commercial space we have this ARM TrustZone feature that is not there and therefore you almost discount yourself and we are completely underrepresented in the commercial space.
We went to our customers with a product roadmap and even in the customers we’re just focusing on the few, the big three, Lenovo, HP and Dell and trying to get volume design wins. And what's changed with AMD is the engineering mind set used to be get the best technology, best technological product and go customize it for every skew at HP or some other Company and that doesn’t pay off, because if something goes wrong, you’ve invested dollars and you don’t the return.
Today it’s high volume. In the commercial space we’re on target to double our design wins compared to where we were in 2013. Customers are very excited and I think you will see that evolve in the second half of 2014.
You mentioned that the enterprise space. Lot of progress there with again the larger customers and then in the low form factor, we have a product now, Mullins which has come out. If you do the benchmarks on any basis as opposed to just doing it with one particular benchmark, you do it with the PCMark benchmark and it comes out very competitive and that product is doing very well and our customers are excited about it.
But make no mistake about it. The PC market our view is down 7% to 10%. A lot of people think we have been conservative, because IDC just came up with some data, I guess few days ago saying is down 6%. Our competitor thinks it’s going to be less than that.
From a planning standpoint I think that sits well with us. From a viewpoint of managing the working capital and expenses, we are planning for 7% and 10% down in the PC space. But being very selective in the Desktop channel space, we have been successful. We’ve had very good progress in 2013 and increasing revenue every quarter in 2013 is what we have done and that will be an area of focus in 2014.
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. In the past when the PC market was growing double-digits a year, in some ways there was good sort of competition between Intel and yourself. But now that the PC market is declining, do you see Intel becoming a little bit more aggressive in terms of pricing and maybe going after areas that they might not have, in light with Bay Trail what I have heard is very aggressive in terms of pricing. So how does that impact?
Devinder Kumar
Yes. I think a little more aggressive is an understatement. It’s very aggressive. But we can be very selective because like I said, our revenue model has already shifted. More than 30% of the revenue coming from the non-PC space allows you to make decisions very differently. Products are competitive. We are very disciplined from a gross margin and operating margin standpoint. The managing for property statement that I made is real. Business units, general managers make decisions whether to take business not based on their entire P&L from top to bottom and that is something.
Yes the competitor is very aggressive but we’re going to show and we’ve shown over the last two or three quarters after we recovered with the first half of 2013 that we’re going to be selective in terms of where we pursue the opportunities in a very targeted manner and actually from my standpoint, with that discipline having been put into place, I'm pretty pleased as to how we’re doing it.
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
Maybe if you talk about the graphics area, why has nVidia managed to gain so much share from AMD over the last few years? And I know this happens in cycles; you’re two thirds of the market, they are one-third and that sort of goes back and forth. So is 50-50 the natural state of the market and how do you get there from where you are today?
Devinder Kumar
I think if you ask me from my standpoint generation to generation, if the market share is 40-60 and it oscillates from one company to another, that’s probably how it will go and that’s the way it’s been. There were some decisions made two-three years ago when we were pushing the APU and our view of how the attach rates are going to change. Some product decisions were made, in particular in the low end. And I think that kind of hurt us in particular with the platform, in particular with decisions that Microsoft made with some customers with the Haswell platform. If there's one area that we’re confident of gaining market share is in the graphics space, not just in professional graphic product, but in the graphic space. And I think as the year evolves, the Ivy Bridge platforms come in to play, the attach rates actually have surprised us. We thought the attach rates would go down. If you ask someone two years ago, the attach rates were expected to go down more but they've actually not gone down as much, and now we [ph] participate in that market to go ahead and get the market share that I think we will see in the second half of 2014.
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. So if somebody from the graphics side comes to you and say, I need more investment, I need more OpEx, how do you react to that?
Devinder Kumar
Well I ask the general manager one question, show me your P&L and what’s the bottom line going to be, but in our GVS segment we have semi-custom in graphics and then the graphics space, they can get the investment and actually they have. We’re doing marketing very differently in the graphics space than what -- we’ve take a page out of our competitors book actually, and with the bundling that we have seen some of the game titles, that’s been very successful.
With the technology that we have, the Apple MacPro using the Dual FirePro AMD device, very successful, in the AIB space in particular with China; despite some challenges from a macro standpoint in China, we have had good success in that area in the early part of 2014.
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And then moving to the server market, I think I have sort of mixed views in that on the one hand I think as you mentioned, you are unique in that you have x86 right. You have the ambidextrous capability, you have graphics, you have access to ARM architecture and your Fabless. So you're forced to fill up a fab for whatever reason right. You can really go after the real demand in the market. But then the skeptics would say, well if AMD was not successful being one out of two x86 vendors and servers, how can it be successful being one out of I don’t know 10, 12, every day the number is increasing, number of potential suppliers in the ARM market. Aren’t you leaving one market that had less competition towards going into a market which is going to be a lot more competitive?
Devinder Kumar
I think yes and no. If you look at the ARM space in particular, so if you talk about servers, there are only so many companies that compete in the server space and we have got 10 years plus. No surprise on the traditional server space. For various reasons we have not done well, market share is nothing much to speak about in the traditional server space. But in the dense server space, especially with our SeaMicro acquisition, we see a lot of opportunities. We are projecting over the longer term that this is going to be an area where space, power and performance, the equation in total is going to be good. ARM obviously gives you some features. We sample products at Seattle. We are going to ship for revenue at the end of this year and that’s our first ARM based 64-bit product, 28 nanometer technology node which is the bulk technology node and the reception from our customers is very good and you will see us do more of that.
This is a projection for the future. Just like in the days of the Opteron, we call the market from a viewpoint of where it’s headed and we see this as backend loaded but we think this is a right call where 25% of the market, the server market is going to be dense server base and we have an opportunity. There has been some movement with some of the other players. One went out of business, the other one I think got acquired with the news that just came out over the last few days.
So, you can see that the folks that are putting in the datacenters themselves are starting to pay attention to say there is something different about the dense server space compared to the traditional server space. And we see ourselves as somebody that could play in that market and be successful, not in 2014 from a significant revenue standpoint, backend loaded in the second half of 2015 and 2016 and beyond. But it’s a call that will play out. I think you are right. This is an area that is still evolving and we will see how it plays out as we get into 2016 when we get to our transformation state.
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
And then moving onto the game console and the semi-custom, so first on the game console, there is -- so obviously very strong execution on getting the products out right and you have essentially locked-up, right, the market with very strong customers. There is some concern in terms of sell- n versus sale-through. So that’s a near-term concern but longer term how do you see AMD’s view of the game console market? Are we headed to like one big year and then it sort of slows down? Is this the peak year, next year is a peak year? How do you manage that business knowing that it is such a consumer oriented?
Devinder Kumar
Yes, consumer but it is changing in terms of current game console products are doing very different things than what the prior generation did; that’s one thing. The second thing is we introduced a product in 2013. We get asked that question a lot. 2013 was kind of -- first second half, what’s going to happen in 2014. 2014 the game console revenue and units, significantly higher for the new generation, significantly higher compared to 2013. And by the way, based on what we see in particular with some developments that you probably read about related to the Chinese market in particular, we think 2015 is better than 2014.
But the life cycle of the products are probably going to be shorter. Our customers are already thinking about what comes next. These are long life cycle products and as you know in the semi-custom space, you start with -- three years before you introduce a product, a decision is made to use a particular company. In this case it was AMD. And then you go ahead and co-develop the product with the funding dollars frankly, mostly coming from our customers. And then when you introduce the product, there is really no expenses from R&D standpoint, no sales and marketing dollars and whatever dollars you generate from a gross margin dollar standpoint, falls to the bottom-line and that’s what excites us.
We have executed as you said -- very strong execution in semi-custom but that has now piqued the interest of many customers that want to do similar stuff beyond game console. And I think this is a proof point with the incredible execution of the game console product that customers are coming towards and saying in mobility, enterprise, living room and even in gaming what comes next and we have a strong pipeline and that’s why the confidence that we will announce, wanted to semi-custom design wins. And by the way these opportunities are not $30 million or $40 million; these are $200 million to $500 million plus range of opportunities. And the best thing about this is once one if you execute, the revenue is going to be there from a viewpoint of generating the dollars to go ahead and benefit the P&L from an operating margin standpoint.

So, AMD has been teasing us about these new wins for some time. So have you already won these and it’s just a matter of, right, how to line-up the announcement or is it that you are in the final stages of knowing, I'm just trying to get a sense of how these things are. We’re all excited to know what these things are.
Devinder Kumar
Very real. Very real. I can tell you that, very real highly confident with one to two design wins this year. However, because it is a semi-custom business just like with the Xbox One and PS4, we talked about in 2012. We said we have confidential semi-custom design wins, but we did not announce right until our customers actually announce in May 2013 timeframe and that’s just a nature of the business, very strict from a confidentiality standpoint. We don’t want to violate that confidence of the customers, but I can tell you very confident, one to two before the end of the year and then one to two going forward with the opportunities are right off demand.
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
Can you give us a sense of end-markets that this might be in, even if?
Devinder Kumar
No.
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
Are these end-markets that you’re participated in before?
Devinder Kumar
Both, I think it’s going to be in the end markets we participate in today and also some other opportunities that we have. So it’s across the board. It’s not just, continuing just with the game console in the next generation, what do you do, but the aperture, I guess is increasing. And the engagement with the customers is very active across many different areas.
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And may be let me pause there and see if there are any questions, from the audience?
Unidentified Analyst
Just a couple of quick questions. Just a clarification on one of your slides. You are saying on the server market, it’s going to be out 25% of the total.
Devinder Kumar
Say again?
Unidentified Analyst
A clarification on one of your slides. You had a slide showing ARM having 25% of the total server market in 2019?
Devinder Kumar
That’s right.
Unidentified Analyst
Is that the total server market?
Devinder Kumar
That’s the dense server space with ARM product, right in the 2019 timeframe, 25% of the server market.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And the second things is ARM is talking about doing 48 core servers in the 2017, 18 timeframe and at the moment everyone views ARM is being a low power server players and low performance server player. Do you think ARM could potentially go into the high performance server play with these 48 core servers that they are talking about?
Devinder Kumar
I think it could but I'm not technically savvy enough to specifically answer that question.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And just one last question on AMCC. They have their own custom core this year and you’re going to have your custom core in 2016. So how will you differentiate your product relative to AMCC’s product?
Devinder Kumar
You know, its matter of having silicon in the market, having the experience with all of the infrastructure and platforms that come with server space, long engagement dealing with the customers. You heard me talking about Verizon using the server products that we are shipping to them in seven out of their 50 plus datacenters. And I think these are things that happen over longer time period because once you make a decision, it stays with you for many, many years. It is possible that, a company like what you just mentioned has a product out there, but we are looking again for the higher volume, longer time period opportunities and we are okay with waiting to go ahead and make that engagement with the products that we are shipping to them today.
Unidentified Analyst
I have question on the tablet market. We see there’s a confluence of things happening right? On the one hand we have 64-bit coming, some high powerful tablets and application processes out there. And over here on the PC side things are slowing. Your competitor has moved in more into the tablet market. Is this an opportunity that you can at some point address? Has tablets become much more like PC’s in high performance and your core bookmark is obviously very weak. Isn't this kind of no brainer, an area that you really need to address to stem the decline in notebooks? Thanks.
Devinder Kumar
I think you have responded to what the consumers want. I think there is still a settling down period happening with the customers, the consumers. The consumers haven’t decided. You go around and you see the devices consumers are buying. I think they haven’t made up their mind. If you look at the tablet forecast that just came out from IDC, it is lower than what they forecasted a year-ago. So there is some shift happening there.
In the PC space obviously with the lower power stuff in market Mullins, when you look at the power equation, the power equation is now competitive -- our competitors, from our power equation and performance standpoint and I think that consumers are going to decide and I don’t think that story has truly unfolded to say like we use doing the old days. It’s going to be this kind of notebook, go ahead and make this product and the consumers will buy. The consumers are all over the map. It's very fragmented. They are fickle just by definition because they are consumers and we will see what happens over the next couple of years.
Unidentified Analyst
Would your view change if we heard -- we have a new CEO at Microsoft trying to -- we heard a major announcement about porting office to say Android on 65 [ph] if you remember. Would your view change if that wasn’t necessary [ph]?
Devinder Kumar
From my standpoint that particular move is a good move. The part that doesn’t make sense to me is again you mentioned the competitor trying to do everything possible and throwing dollars from a viewpoint of trying to create a market. I think consumers have become savvy enough whereby the short term money that you throw at them is not going to be making a decisions about longer term. This is the device of choice that I want and that is the thing that’s going to play out. Being a fabulous company and not having the debt, the burden of the fab, it makes it a lot easier to go ahead and say, as Vivek said earlier, I don’t need to go for the fabs, and by the way even the $1.2 billion WSA take-or-pay agreement that I did in 2014, a significant portion of that is semi-custom and graphics, not just PCs. And I think you see our relationship with Global Foundries, one of our two foundry partners evolving and the business that we get with them is going to be based on what AMDs business is going to be with the demand that we have.
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
Devinder I'm glad you bought up the WSA and Global Foundries. One would say that -- is that a higher risk approach in that, you are at TSMC -- you’re still with TSMC but you’re shifting wafers, you’re shifting more demand towards Global Foundries. At some -- it’s 20% above last year.
Devinder Kumar
Go ahead, let me let you finish your question.
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
So isn’t that a risk in that, you have a foundry where the manufacturing and process and everything is leading edge, well proven and you are going towards a player where there are management changes. Are there incremental risks to this move?
Devinder Kumar
There is always risk but by the same equation, just like anything else, if you can have a balanced strategy with a couple of foundries, it’s a good thing. Being able to shift wafers even execution or the yields are somewhat different. I look at it from an effective die cost standpoint. And if I can get the same financial equation whether I make it here or there, then that’s a good thing for me and always having two or more is better and in our case we have very good relationship in both, the WSA that we signed, you talked about 20% higher than last year. But bear in mind that our view of the PC market is 7% to 10% down and I can tell you that within the 1.2 billion, the PC product purchases are very much in line with what our view of the market is the PC business, very much in line, and that’s why we have confidence, if we execute 2014 that we can work our inventory down from where we ended in 2013 to the end of 2014 and all of this inventory is 28 nanometers as you reference and is healthy, it’s a good mix of inventory and I actually feel probably the best. I have been involved with the Global Foundries, WSA ever since their inception in 2009 and I can tell you that I feel the best about this last agreement that we signed than any agreement that we have signed in the last five years.
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
Any last questions from the audience? Let me ask the last one. You did some debt transactions yesterday. You could paint the bigger picture about what that means for your financials and just the related question to that, if you look at AMD over the next few years. Is this from now on more a top line growth driven story, or are there still things you can do, whether it’s from your balance sheet or on the debt side or whether there are things on OpEx you can do to create another tailwind for margins.
Devinder Kumar
I think both, I think 2014 as we have said grow revenue over 2013. So it is top line growth. But on the balance sheet coming back to the debt transaction we did yesterday, very opportunistic, 7% money with a call feature up to five years, 10 year note due in 2024 and reducing the interest expense. So net-net, the second part of it is not done. We are trending with the 2017 notes, but let’s say we’re successful with that. We get notes tender, notes at 8.1 to 5. In fact that particular note also has an OID feature that was done in the 2009 timeframe. So the effective interest rate on the P&L for that particular note is 10%. So the difference in the interest expense is 10% or 7%. You do the math in terms of the savings, it’s at least $3 million a quarter that you save, and by the way it’s a straight note with a call option, 10 year money at 7%. I feel very good about that.
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
And in terms of just OpEx are there things that are still to be done or you think OpEx is right sized now and…
Devinder Kumar
Depends upon execution and delivery. We are managing for profitability. We’ll do things if we need to but this year we packed it at $420 million to $450 million and then going back to the debt piece of it, I think $2 million is still much of a debt burden on the Company and as we execute and move forward, the target will be to bring down the debt burden of the company and have less debt than what we have today.
Vivek Arya - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch

2014-06-04,"AMD is the first company to offer its customers both ARM and x86 architecture based solutions for low-power and high-performance embedded compute designs.
AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has announced new x86 G-Series system-on-chip (SoC) and central processing unit (CPU) solutions for embedded applications, including early adoption by HP for thin client deployment in healthcare, finance, education and retail, as well as Advantech for industrial applications in rugged environments. The new products expand upon the high-performance and low-power capabilities of AMD’s existing Embedded G-Series platform. AMD claims that its embedded G-series SoC family is one of the most widely adopted platforms in the history of AMD Embedded Solutions, and the new solutions bring better capabilities, experiences and ecosystem support.
In an effort to reduce its dependence on the declining traditional PC market, AMD has increased its focus on new growth markets. As part of its restructuring efforts, the company intends to derive 50% of its revenue from high growth businesses, including embedded solutions, semi-custom, ultra-low power client, professional graphics and dense server, by the end of 2015.
We estimate embedded processors to contribute around 10% to AMD’s valuation and forecast revenue from this division to cross $750 million over our review period. AMD is the first company to offer its customers both ARM and x86 architecture based solutions for low-power and high-performance embedded compute designs. There is a growing need for more advanced embedded solutions in healthcare, finance, education and retail services. We expect new product launches this year to accelerate AMD’s growth in the embedded market.
Our price estimate of $3.79 for AMD is almost in line with the current market price.
AMD has a broad range of embedded processors for different segments in its portfolio, offering a number of price, performance and power options to meet the needs of embedded designers. The company intends to take on the different segments in the embedded market by offering its customers a range of solutions to chose from – from low-power to high-performance - with a broad ecosystem of software and hardware partners supporting multiple operating systems, including Windows and Linux. The introduction of the new products further expands AMD’s embedded product portfolio.
- Embedded G-Series SoC Solutions: Code-named “Steppe Eagle,” the new embedded G-series SoC solutions offer 53% higher overall performance compared to previous G-Series SoC solutions. The new processors offer enhanced security features, ultra low power consumption and advanced graphics performance for rugged applications such as ATMs, kiosks, automation, medical equipment and gaming machines.
- Embedded G-Series CPU Solutions: Code-named “Crowned Eagle,” the new G-series CPU solutions come with a 64 bit processor (based on dual- or quad-core x86 CPU architecture), and are best suited for networking and communications infrastructure applications. Cost and energy efficiency are important parameters, as data centers continue to scale up to meet the rising demand brought by the cloud and the increasing proliferation of devices. The new solutions claim to offer 34% more CPU-centric performance-per-dollar than competing Intel solutions.
How Big Is The Embedded Processors Market ?
The embedded processors segment is a fast growing market with the embedded x86 market slated to reach $7 billion by 2016. As per the VDC Research report, the market for traditional and intelligent embedded CPU systems will grow 36% in the next few years, from 330 million units in 2013 to over 450 million units by 2016. The x86 and ARM architecture together are estimated to account for 82% of the total addressable market.
Disclosure: No positions."
